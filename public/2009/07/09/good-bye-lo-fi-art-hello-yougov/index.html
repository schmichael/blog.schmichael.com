   <p class="meta"><small>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-calendar-o"></i> 2009-07-09</small></p> <hr/>
   <div class="post">
     <p>Next week I&#8217;ll be leaving <a href="http://lofiart.com/">Lo-Fi Art</a> to start working for <a href="http://polimetrix.com/">YouGov Polimetrix</a> (aka PMX). For the past couple of years I&#8217;ve been consulting with Chris Pitzer mostly as a Python web developer specializing in Django. It will be sad to stop working for a company I own with a friend, but I&#8217;ve been working part time for PMX and am excited to work for them full time.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for my decision, but I should make it clear that it has nothing to do with Chris! It has been great working with him, and I&#8217;m glad we get to continue to share office space even if we&#8217;re working on different things. There is <em>plenty</em> of client work stacking up for him to do as well, so I&#8217;m not bailing on a sinking ship.</p>

<p><strong>So why am I leaving Lo-Fi Art?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest reason is probably stress. I&#8217;ve just stopped enjoying client work because if I&#8217;m not stressed about getting the current client done on time, I&#8217;m stressed about finding the next client. If its not one of those two things, I&#8217;m probably stressed about when the next check is coming in. How much was it for again? Wait, did I already get that one? Argh! On top of that I&#8217;m <em>terrible</em> at managing money. While Chris does a great job with the company books, that doesn&#8217;t keep me from screwing up my own (don&#8217;t even ask me about how my tax return went this year).</p>

<p>On top of that, contracting gigs just have a lot of <strong>overhead</strong>. For me overhead is anything that keeps me from writing code. I really don&#8217;t enjoy writing proposals and meeting with clients to discuss (or often: haggle over) implementation details. Its not that I don&#8217;t like <em>people</em>. I love people! But I like working with a <strong>team</strong> more than a <strong>client</strong>.</p>

<p>Some people really thrive in the consulting world. I think its just taken me years to realize I&#8217;m not one of those people. I could see returning to consulting someday, but I can&#8217;t imagine it would ever be back to the 2-4 week projects I currently spend most of my time on.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I joining YouGov Polimetrix?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a consultant for PMX working on the <a href="http://www.brandindex.com">BrandIndex</a> project for over a year now, and it was getting to the point where I needed to either commit or focus purely on Lo-Fi work. It was a really hard decision, but in the end PMX just gives me the opportunity to do what I love. I work in a fantastic team* with lots of fun technology in an organization that places high value on their IT resources. What more could I ask for? Oh yeah, a steady paycheck. That was a plus too. ðŸ˜‰</p>
