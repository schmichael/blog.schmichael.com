   <div class="post">
     <p>I bought a laptop recently because being a web consultant and tied to a desktop is not only embarrassing, but is a quick way to lose (or at least frustrate) clients who&#8217;d love to see my hairy hacker face on-site.</p>

<p>I use Linux, Firefox, and vim for work so my requirements for a laptop basically came down to WiFi. I also didn&#8217;t want something big and clunky because I&#8217;m looking to augment my desktop, not replace it.</p>

<p>I finally settled on searching in the 13&#8243;-14&#8243; range for anything with dual cores (so Flash can destroy 1 core while the other lets me continue to work unphased) and 2 GB of RAM (that usually gives me &gt; 1 GB for harddrive caching which speeds things up a lot &#8212; plenty of room to run an XP VM as well).</p>

<p>Despite affectionately nicknaming my aging Thinkpad a &#8220;Brickpad&#8221; due to its big-black-box design, I love Thinkpads and have found them to be exceptionally well made and reliable. Unfortunately they just weren&#8217;t in the budget this around around.</p>

<p>At this point my search had narrowed down a bit, and I began searching for the easiest way to get the most bang for my buck: getting a laptop without Microsoft Windows. Even if Windows only adds $50 to the purchase price, that&#8217;s a significant amount of money when you&#8217;re shopping in the $500-600 range. That and I can remote into the XP VM on my desktop for cross-browser testing (my only use for Windows).</p>

<p>Unfortunately with the exception of tiny netbooks, there aren&#8217;t many Windowless laptops out there (not paying extra for an Apple either, sorry). Dell has one (or a few?), but I&#8217;ve had too many bad experiences with Dells dying prematurely (IMHO, YMMV, etc). HP lets you get Windowless laptops, but only if you pay extra to customize your laptop. Oh well.</p>

<p>So once I gave up on that dream, I just went for cheap and found an <a href="http://us.acer.com/acer/productv.do?link=oln15e.redirect&amp;changedAlts=&amp;CRC=1511809838">Acer Extensa 4630Z</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Linux on an Acer Extensa 4630Z</strong></p>

<p>I decided to go with Ubuntu 8.10 instead of my usual choice of Debian and fought around with getting /home and my swap partition encrypted. I&#8217;ll probably keep using Debian on servers, but its politics have just gotten so annoying as to convince me I never really want to work to become a member of that community.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown of what works, what doesn&#8217;t:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ralink RT2860 802.11b/g/Draft-N WiFi adapter &#8211; Ugh. Its &#8220;working&#8221; using [Ralink&#8217;s drivers][2], but not with Network Manager. I&#8217;ll have to keep playing around with it, but for now its working adequately.</li>
<li>Crazy &euro; and $ keys above the arrow keys do <em>not</em> work, but I&#8217;m not sure what purpose they serve.</li>
<li>Intel graphics card works fine with Compiz (although I just use Metacity).</li>
<li>Suspend but <em>not</em> hibernate. Argh! Does hibernate work for any Linux users? I haven&#8217;t even tried in years.</li>
<li>Webcam, speakers, mic, &amp; screen dimming work</li>
</ul>

<p>It will interesting to see how I like moving from a Debian desktop to an Ubuntu laptop.</p>
