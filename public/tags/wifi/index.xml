      <title>New Laptop: Acer Extensa 4630Z</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a laptop recently because being a web consultant and tied to a desktop is not only embarrassing, but is a quick way to lose (or at least frustrate) clients who&amp;#8217;d love to see my hairy hacker face on-site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Linux, Firefox, and vim for work so my requirements for a laptop basically came down to WiFi. I also didn&amp;#8217;t want something big and clunky because I&amp;#8217;m looking to augment my desktop, not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally settled on searching in the 13&amp;#8243;-14&amp;#8243; range for anything with dual cores (so Flash can destroy 1 core while the other lets me continue to work unphased) and 2 GB of RAM (that usually gives me &amp;gt; 1 GB for harddrive caching which speeds things up a lot &amp;#8212; plenty of room to run an XP VM as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite affectionately nicknaming my aging Thinkpad a &amp;#8220;Brickpad&amp;#8221; due to its big-black-box design, I love Thinkpads and have found them to be exceptionally well made and reliable. Unfortunately they just weren&amp;#8217;t in the budget this around around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point my search had narrowed down a bit, and I began searching for the easiest way to get the most bang for my buck: getting a laptop without Microsoft Windows. Even if Windows only adds $50 to the purchase price, that&amp;#8217;s a significant amount of money when you&amp;#8217;re shopping in the $500-600 range. That and I can remote into the XP VM on my desktop for cross-browser testing (my only use for Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately with the exception of tiny netbooks, there aren&amp;#8217;t many Windowless laptops out there (not paying extra for an Apple either, sorry). Dell has one (or a few?), but I&amp;#8217;ve had too many bad experiences with Dells dying prematurely (IMHO, YMMV, etc). HP lets you get Windowless laptops, but only if you pay extra to customize your laptop. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So once I gave up on that dream, I just went for cheap and found an &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.acer.com/acer/productv.do?link=oln15e.redirect&amp;amp;changedAlts=&amp;amp;CRC=1511809838&#34;&gt;Acer Extensa 4630Z&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux on an Acer Extensa 4630Z&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Ubuntu 8.10 instead of my usual choice of Debian and fought around with getting /home and my swap partition encrypted. I&amp;#8217;ll probably keep using Debian on servers, but its politics have just gotten so annoying as to convince me I never really want to work to become a member of that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the rundown of what works, what doesn&amp;#8217;t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ralink RT2860 802.11b/g/Draft-N WiFi adapter &amp;#8211; Ugh. Its &amp;#8220;working&amp;#8221; using [Ralink&amp;#8217;s drivers][2], but not with Network Manager. I&amp;#8217;ll have to keep playing around with it, but for now its working adequately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crazy &amp;euro; and $ keys above the arrow keys do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure what purpose they serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel graphics card works fine with Compiz (although I just use Metacity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspend but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; hibernate. Argh! Does hibernate work for any Linux users? I haven&amp;#8217;t even tried in years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webcam, speakers, mic, &amp;amp; screen dimming work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will interesting to see how I like moving from a Debian desktop to an Ubuntu laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Cable Internet, 22â€³ LCD, and WiFi!</title>
      <link>https://blog.schmichael.com/2007/12/17/new-cable-internet-22-lcd-and-wifi/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.schmichael.com/2007/12/17/new-cable-internet-22-lcd-and-wifi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was my work Christmas! I work from home most of the time, so I&amp;#8217;m finally getting around to upgrading some of the equipment I use for my job every day. Today I got 3 new pieces of technology and just finished setting them all up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodbye ATT&amp;amp;T!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched from 1.5 Mbps/386 Kbps DSL to 10 Mbps/1 Mbps cable broadband today. I used to download packages at 140 KBps to 160 KBps, but now I easily reach over 1 MBps. Tomorrow I get to call AT&amp;amp;T and cancel not only my DSL but also my landline phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside is starting in 2008, my local cable company, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insight-com.com/&#34;&gt;Insight&lt;/a&gt;, is going to become &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.comcast.com/&#34;&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt;. It took me about 10 seconds to get a human on the line when calling Insight. When I tried to call Comcast to find out if anything was going to change, I had to call &lt;em&gt;3 different phone numbers&lt;/em&gt; until I finally reached a sales person who kept trying to sell me a package deal for broadband/tv/phone even though Comcast isn&amp;#8217;t in my area yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales representatives for both companies seemed very confused that a person would only want Internet access. My wife &amp;amp; I watch all of our TV online or through Netflix, and we don&amp;#8217;t need a landline phone. Is that really so strange these days? I suppose most people still have cable TV or satellite, but with more shows becoming available for free online I don&amp;#8217;t see the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello 22&amp;#8243; LCD!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got a nice LCD and got rid of my $5 19&amp;#8243; inch CRT (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.christopherpitzer.com/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, it was nice while it lasted). Its a Hanns-G HG216D no frills monitor. There was a similarly priced Acer monitor, by the Hanns-G is Energy Star which I like. It looks beautiful to me, but I have to admit the built-in 1 watt speakers are a complete joke for anything error than error beeps. Luckily they&amp;#8217;re hidden in the back of the LCD case, so no one even has to notice them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup in Linux was as simple as pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace in GDM to restart X. It worked as soon as I plugged it in, but restarting X Windows auto-detected the resolution properly so I didn&amp;#8217;t have to mess around in my xorg.conf file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X Windows has come a very very long way in the past year or two. My xorg.conf file is tiny, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure why I even have it. Last time I tried, X Windows autodetected everything just fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh come on&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254024&#34;&gt;3 days later and my monitor has already dropped $20 in price. Yeesh.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Wi-Fi in Linux? Yes, but&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My office is upstairs, and our only cable connections are downstairs. Instead of running unsightly cables through our house or drilling holes, I just bought a Wi-Fi card for my desktop. Finding a card that works well with Linux was very very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=3350606&amp;amp;sku=D145-1006&#34;&gt;TP-Link TL-WN651G&lt;/a&gt; (Ver 1.5), but the box also lists the model as TL-WN650G. Most importantly it works perfectly with the [MadWiFi]&lt;a href=&#34;it uses an Atheros chipset&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Its running at 802.11g with WPA2. The PCI card was only $25, so I didn&amp;#8217;t even have to spend too much more for Linux compatibility. I question the reliability of those $10-$15 adapters anyway&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only caveat is caused by Debian&amp;#8217;s insistence on freeness and hatred of binary modules. The MadWiFi module uses a binary module, so Debian makes you download a source package and compile it using &lt;code&gt;module-assistant&lt;/code&gt;. Now m-a is a wonderful program, but this is still the reason I &lt;em&gt;always recommend Ubuntu to desktop users.&lt;/em&gt; Expecting anyone other than a Linux hacker to install some random package and run some random command line tool to get WiFi working is deranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motto: Debian is for developers, Ubuntu is for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I&amp;#8217;ve had a wonderful day and am excited all my new toys play well with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wireless Bridges are a Scam</title>
      <link>https://blog.schmichael.com/2007/12/18/wireless-bridges-are-a-scam/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.schmichael.com/2007/12/18/wireless-bridges-are-a-scam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a hardware guy. The days when I enjoyed cracking open a computer case and poking around are long since past. These days if I can&amp;#8217;t fix something via keyboard, I want no part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for a client I needed to extend a LAN from Building A across 30 feet of asphalt to Building B. Time to don my Net Admin hat to install a nice straightforward WiFi bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite already owning a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G&#34;&gt;Linksys WRT54G series router&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to just pickup 2 Linksys &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&amp;amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;amp;cid=1134692497433&amp;amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&amp;amp;lid=9743339789B32&#34;&gt;WET54G&lt;/a&gt; wireless bridges (version 3.1). The &lt;strong&gt;bridges are actually &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; expensive than routers.&lt;/strong&gt; But that just means they&amp;#8217;re better suited for their simple task, right? Wrong&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 WET54Gs have been nothing but trouble for me. Their web interface sometimes redirects to the hardcoded IP address. They drop their connection and require resetting a lot. They just don&amp;#8217;t work reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I flashed the WRT54G with Tomato firmware to replace one of the WET54Gs, and so far things are working much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#8217;ve never mentioned it before: &lt;strong&gt;I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato&#34;&gt;Tomato&lt;/a&gt; firmware.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve been using it at home for ages and &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; have to reset it. The [features][4] are outstanding (QoS with ACK Prioritization is a lifesaver when working over SSH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on anytime I need a WiFi router, access point, or bridge, I&amp;#8217;m going to buy a WRT54G and put Tomato on it. Its cheaper than buying specialized Access Points or Bridges and has lots more features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention Tomato generates sexy real-time graphs in SVG? Have a screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
