      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally made it up to biking to work 3 times this week! Had only been averaging about once every 2 weeks for the past couple months. Sam &amp;amp; I recently moved to North Portland which is flat. We had been living in the very hilly Southwest area of town, and biking to work from there was killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really didn&amp;#8217;t realize how much my situation had improved until my friend, Aaron Colflesh, pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heywhatsthat.com/profiler.html&#34;&gt;HeyWhatsThat.com&lt;/a&gt; which generates elevation change profiles for you based on coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My current route from home to work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/files/new-route.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/files/new-route.png&#34; alt=&#34;current route to work&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a good 100&amp;#8242; hill in it. Not fun on the way home, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t last too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now compare that to my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; route from home to work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder I never did it more than once a week! It was brutal coming home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re much happier in North Portland in general, but finding these diagrams made me feel much better about struggling to get on bike at the old place. &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:-)&#34; class=&#34;wp-smiley&#34; style=&#34;height: 1em; max-height: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
