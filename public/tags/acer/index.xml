      <title>New Laptop: Acer Extensa 4630Z</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a laptop recently because being a web consultant and tied to a desktop is not only embarrassing, but is a quick way to lose (or at least frustrate) clients who&amp;#8217;d love to see my hairy hacker face on-site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Linux, Firefox, and vim for work so my requirements for a laptop basically came down to WiFi. I also didn&amp;#8217;t want something big and clunky because I&amp;#8217;m looking to augment my desktop, not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally settled on searching in the 13&amp;#8243;-14&amp;#8243; range for anything with dual cores (so Flash can destroy 1 core while the other lets me continue to work unphased) and 2 GB of RAM (that usually gives me &amp;gt; 1 GB for harddrive caching which speeds things up a lot &amp;#8212; plenty of room to run an XP VM as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite affectionately nicknaming my aging Thinkpad a &amp;#8220;Brickpad&amp;#8221; due to its big-black-box design, I love Thinkpads and have found them to be exceptionally well made and reliable. Unfortunately they just weren&amp;#8217;t in the budget this around around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point my search had narrowed down a bit, and I began searching for the easiest way to get the most bang for my buck: getting a laptop without Microsoft Windows. Even if Windows only adds $50 to the purchase price, that&amp;#8217;s a significant amount of money when you&amp;#8217;re shopping in the $500-600 range. That and I can remote into the XP VM on my desktop for cross-browser testing (my only use for Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately with the exception of tiny netbooks, there aren&amp;#8217;t many Windowless laptops out there (not paying extra for an Apple either, sorry). Dell has one (or a few?), but I&amp;#8217;ve had too many bad experiences with Dells dying prematurely (IMHO, YMMV, etc). HP lets you get Windowless laptops, but only if you pay extra to customize your laptop. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So once I gave up on that dream, I just went for cheap and found an &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.acer.com/acer/productv.do?link=oln15e.redirect&amp;amp;changedAlts=&amp;amp;CRC=1511809838&#34;&gt;Acer Extensa 4630Z&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux on an Acer Extensa 4630Z&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Ubuntu 8.10 instead of my usual choice of Debian and fought around with getting /home and my swap partition encrypted. I&amp;#8217;ll probably keep using Debian on servers, but its politics have just gotten so annoying as to convince me I never really want to work to become a member of that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the rundown of what works, what doesn&amp;#8217;t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ralink RT2860 802.11b/g/Draft-N WiFi adapter &amp;#8211; Ugh. Its &amp;#8220;working&amp;#8221; using [Ralink&amp;#8217;s drivers][2], but not with Network Manager. I&amp;#8217;ll have to keep playing around with it, but for now its working adequately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crazy &amp;euro; and $ keys above the arrow keys do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure what purpose they serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel graphics card works fine with Compiz (although I just use Metacity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspend but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; hibernate. Argh! Does hibernate work for any Linux users? I haven&amp;#8217;t even tried in years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webcam, speakers, mic, &amp;amp; screen dimming work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will interesting to see how I like moving from a Debian desktop to an Ubuntu laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
