      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, December 21st&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is the not chance the weather and stay overnight at the airport tonight to make sure to catch our 6:30am flight Monday morning. Here&amp;#8217;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:00am &amp;#8211; 4:45pm &amp;#8211; Packing, checking Trimet service alerts and flight cancellations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4:45pm &amp;#8211; 6:00pm &amp;#8211; Waiting at bus stop for a bus that never came. Met a cool guy named Rob though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:20pm &amp;#8211; Home, get call from US Airways our flight is canceled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:30pm &amp;#8211; Power goes out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:00pm &amp;#8211; 9:00pm &amp;#8211; I go on a hike. Notice my wedding ring is missing. Spend next hour hiking and digging through snow looking for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10pm &amp;#8211; Go to bed depressed, but quite warm in our sleeping bags under every blanket we own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:00am &amp;#8211; Get up, still no power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:00am &amp;#8211; 12:00am &amp;#8211; Get crazy idea to try to make it to the Pitzer&amp;#8217;s in the Focus. Took 15 minutes to thaw the car and drive 15&amp;#8242; to our house. Took almost 2 hours of the greatest neighbor in the world helping put my chains back on about a dozen times just to get my car parked in front of our house.&lt;br /&gt;
Pitzer&amp;#8217;s house is not going to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:00pm &amp;#8211; Power is back! Yay! Now we just have to figure out how to save Christmas&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that the PGE (utility company) truck showed up at about 11:45am at which point my car was stuck chainless in the middle of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
