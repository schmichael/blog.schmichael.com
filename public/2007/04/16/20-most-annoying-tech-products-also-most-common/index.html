   <div class="post">
     <p>I wish I could brag that I&#8217;ve never linked to fluff &#8220;Top 5/10/20/100&#8221; pieces, but something struck me about PC World&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130638-page,1/article.html?tk=pr_20MATP">The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products</a> (found via <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/16/2017207.shtml">Slashdot</a>):</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130638-page,7-c,techindustrytrends/article.html">Top 10</a>, which were the products chosen by users, is more or less a list of the top 10 most popular software applications.</strong></p>

<p>I agree with most of them as well:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>AOL CDs</strong> &#8212; Definitely most annoying. Yet AOL dominated the ISP industry until broadband decimated its dial-up business.</li>
<li><strong>Windows Me</strong> &#8212; Ironically I was the only person I knew with a Windows Me laptop that <em>didn&#8217;t hate it</em>. It was a terrible product, yet very popular due to the fact there were a couple of years where every consumer grade computer came with it.</li>
<li><strong>Anything with DRM</strong> &#8212; <em><strong>Amen!</strong></em> Yet DRM-laden music services are the most popular. Wise up people: join <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">eEmusic</a>!</li>
<li><strong>McAfee &amp; Norton Internet Security Suites</strong>* &#8212; These pieces of bloatware are the only products that make Outlook seem trim and sexy. Forget bulky security suites and just get Linux or even a Mac.</li>
<li><strong>RealPlayer</strong> &#8212; Worst. Media player. Ever. Yet tons of sites choose it for content delivery. To make matters worse its the only major media player to [offer an open source version (which is just as terrible as the proprietary version)][5].</li>
<li><strong>Bonzi Buddy</strong> &#8212; The malware that started it all.</li>
<li><strong>MySpace</strong> &#8212; A terrible blackhole crushing the souls of our youth into a singularity of narcism. Yet its the only way I can stay in touch with some of my friends&#8230; I feel dirty&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Windows Update</strong> &#8212; Since I&#8217;m basically in charge of Windows Updates at work, my hatred for Windows Update runs deep. Whatever software architect thought <em>updating an operating system via an ActiveX control in a web browser was a good idea needs to find a new line of work.</em> Who would come up with such a terrible system? The only way it could be worse is if it used <em>Outlook Express as its delivery mechanism.</em></li>
<li><strong>Windows Vista</strong> &#8212; Hey, other people voted for it, not me. üòâ</li>
<li><strong>Apple QuickTime</strong> &#8212; Just as worthless and bloated as all of the other major media players.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the exception of Bonzi Buddy, <strong>the other products all represent industry leaders</strong> (or were at some time). There&#8217;s plenty of alternatives out there (and not just open source ones), but for the most part users are lazy: they&#8217;ll use whatever comes with their computer. And even I&#8217;ll admit switching and learning something new is difficult.</p>

<p><small>* Personal anecdote about Symantec (a.k.a. Norton) products: You can&#8217;t use secure e-mail (SMTP/POP3/IMAP via SSL/TLS) with them because then they can&#8217;t do their flaky transparent proxy virus scanning. How&#8217;s that for security?</small></p>
