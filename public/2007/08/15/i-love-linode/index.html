   <div class="post">
     <p>I just signed up for a new <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> account. This is the fourth account I&#8217;ve created with them over the years, and I&#8217;ve always been very pleased. I wish I do a side-by-side comparison with another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vps">VPS</a> host, but I&#8217;ve never had any reason to shop around.</p>

<p><small>I guess I did administer a Windows 2003 VPS on <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> for a while. The experience was too horrific to even try to compare to Linode. Why anyone would want a Windows web server is beyond me. At the time we had been fooled into using ASP.NET to build a huge web application. I&#8217;ll never make that mistake again.</small></p>

<p>Linode is a VPS provider which uses <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User Mode Linux</a> to create virtual Linux servers which run as a process on top of a physical Linux server. While <a href="http://www.xensource.com">Xen</a> seems to be the one getting all of the hype these days, UML is extremely stable, secure, and mature. Each user is allocated a pool of <a href="http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/IO_Tokens">IO tokens</a> which refills at a static rate. This allows servers to have high burst IO rates while preventing any single virtual server from hogging the IO. It seems to work quite well.</p>

<p>Registration was quick and easy. My only minor complaint is that there&#8217;s about an hour wait between when you&#8217;re billed and when you&#8217;re account is activated. When I asked their support about this I got a fast reply from Thomas Asaro:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every signup is manually reviewed and approved by staff. This is to prevent fraudulent signups, protect the credit card holders, and protect our network. Our average activation time is 1 hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s probably my favorite thing about Linode: <strong>excellent support.</strong> Whether its via e-mail, their <a href="http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/IO_Tokens">wiki</a>, <a href="http://www.linode.com/irc/">IRC</a>, or <a href="http://www.linode.com/forums">forums</a>, the Linode staff and users have always been quick to help.</p>

<p>I started using Linode years ago when I worked for <a href="http://www.synthesyssolutions.com/">Synthesys Solutions</a>. At the time we were using some terrible shared hosting provider that was constantly having problems. We decided not to risk our luck with another shared hosting provider, and I configured a Linode for hosting our web sites and e-mail.</p>

<p>The only performance issues I had with Linode were caused by spam. We scanned all of our e-mail for viruses with [ClamAV][9]. While ClamAV is a fantastic solution, like all virus scanners its very resource intensive. So a spam bomb would hit our server and bring it to an unusable crawl for anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour. A faster Linode would have helped, but administering an e-mail server is always going to be a constant battle (unless you don&#8217;t care about your users).</p>

<p>For now I plan on still using DreamHost for e-mail hosting to avoid the spam battle. While the stability isn&#8217;t what I would like, POP3 users rarely, if ever, notice. And right now I don&#8217;t host enough e-mail addresses to warrant the headache of managing it myself.</p>

<p>I highly recommend Linode to anyone looking for an extremely reliable Linux hosting service who doesn&#8217;t want to spend a lot on a dedicated server.</p>
