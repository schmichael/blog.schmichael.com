   <div class="post">
     <p>Today was my work Christmas! I work from home most of the time, so I&#8217;m finally getting around to upgrading some of the equipment I use for my job every day. Today I got 3 new pieces of technology and just finished setting them all up!</p>

<p><strong>Goodbye ATT&amp;T!</strong></p>

<p>I switched from 1.5 Mbps/386 Kbps DSL to 10 Mbps/1 Mbps cable broadband today. I used to download packages at 140 KBps to 160 KBps, but now I easily reach over 1 MBps. Tomorrow I get to call AT&amp;T and cancel not only my DSL but also my landline phone.</p>

<p>The only downside is starting in 2008, my local cable company, <a href="http://www.insight-com.com/">Insight</a>, is going to become <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a>. It took me about 10 seconds to get a human on the line when calling Insight. When I tried to call Comcast to find out if anything was going to change, I had to call <em>3 different phone numbers</em> until I finally reached a sales person who kept trying to sell me a package deal for broadband/tv/phone even though Comcast isn&#8217;t in my area yet!</p>

<p>Sales representatives for both companies seemed very confused that a person would only want Internet access. My wife &amp; I watch all of our TV online or through Netflix, and we don&#8217;t need a landline phone. Is that really so strange these days? I suppose most people still have cable TV or satellite, but with more shows becoming available for free online I don&#8217;t see the point.</p>

<p><strong>Hello 22&#8243; LCD!</strong></p>

<p>I finally got a nice LCD and got rid of my $5 19&#8243; inch CRT (thanks <a href="http://blog.christopherpitzer.com/">Chris</a>, it was nice while it lasted). Its a Hanns-G HG216D no frills monitor. There was a similarly priced Acer monitor, by the Hanns-G is Energy Star which I like. It looks beautiful to me, but I have to admit the built-in 1 watt speakers are a complete joke for anything error than error beeps. Luckily they&#8217;re hidden in the back of the LCD case, so no one even has to notice them.</p>

<p>Setup in Linux was as simple as pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace in GDM to restart X. It worked as soon as I plugged it in, but restarting X Windows auto-detected the resolution properly so I didn&#8217;t have to mess around in my xorg.conf file.</p>

<p>X Windows has come a very very long way in the past year or two. My xorg.conf file is tiny, and I&#8217;m not sure why I even have it. Last time I tried, X Windows autodetected everything just fine!</p>

<p>Oh come on&#8230; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254024">3 days later and my monitor has already dropped $20 in price. Yeesh.</a></p>

<p><strong>Working Wi-Fi in Linux? Yes, but&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>My office is upstairs, and our only cable connections are downstairs. Instead of running unsightly cables through our house or drilling holes, I just bought a Wi-Fi card for my desktop. Finding a card that works well with Linux was very very difficult.</p>

<p>In the end I bought a <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=3350606&amp;sku=D145-1006">TP-Link TL-WN651G</a> (Ver 1.5), but the box also lists the model as TL-WN650G. Most importantly it works perfectly with the [MadWiFi]<a href="it uses an Atheros chipset">6</a>. Its running at 802.11g with WPA2. The PCI card was only $25, so I didn&#8217;t even have to spend too much more for Linux compatibility. I question the reliability of those $10-$15 adapters anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>The only caveat is caused by Debian&#8217;s insistence on freeness and hatred of binary modules. The MadWiFi module uses a binary module, so Debian makes you download a source package and compile it using <code>module-assistant</code>. Now m-a is a wonderful program, but this is still the reason I <em>always recommend Ubuntu to desktop users.</em> Expecting anyone other than a Linux hacker to install some random package and run some random command line tool to get WiFi working is deranged.</p>

<p>My motto: Debian is for developers, Ubuntu is for people.</p>

<p>At any rate, I&#8217;ve had a wonderful day and am excited all my new toys play well with Linux.</p>
