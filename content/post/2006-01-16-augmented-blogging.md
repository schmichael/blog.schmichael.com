[Aaron][1] was kind enough to upgrade my blog to [WordPress][2] [2.0][3] along with his own. I&#8217;m going to try and reorganize my blog as the organic method of creating categories as they occur to me has worked out suboptimally, and the default theme is a bit boring.
  
My new tagline, _Synthesys Computer Solutions Augmentation Research Center_, is due to my new obsession with the book [What the Dormouse Said: How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer by John Markoff][4] <img width="1" height="1" border="0" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=michaelsblog-20&#038;l=ur2&#038;o=1" />and [Douglas Engelbart][5].
