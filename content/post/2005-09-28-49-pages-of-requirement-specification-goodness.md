Just sent off a 49 page Requirements Specification to a client. Most of it was created in OpenOffice.org Writer 1.1.5 and MS Visio 2003 (because [Dia][1] just doesn&#8217;t quite cut it). I love OpenOffice Writer, and it&#8217;s simple little Stylist window for applying styles. I hope that doesn&#8217;t change much in 2.0.

But then came integrating 10 OpenOffice.org documents and over 30 Visio diagrams into one Microsoft Word document (per the client&#8217;s request). **I hate Microsoft Word.** It was a pain to apply styles, and sometimes they just didn&#8217;t turn out properly. And how many times can Microsoft change User Interface styles within one program?! Some things open in sidebars, many in pop-up windows with sub pop-up windows&#8230;

At any rate it&#8217;s done now &#8230; until we have to create a second draft &#8230;
