I spent half an hour tonight finding a AAA battery to resurrect my ancient 512 MB SanDisk SDMX1 MP3 player, so I could listen to [LugRadio][1] while washing dishes.

I&#8217;ve never listened before, but after seeing [Jono Bacon listed as the #1 Linux blog][2] I decided to give it a chance. There was a great interview with one of my geek heroes [Miguel de Icaza][3]. He always seems to be surrounded by controversy even though his decisions are very pragmatic and always end up being exceedingly beneficial to the open source community.

I actually didn&#8217;t listen to the whole [episode][4] (stopped on the bit about the streaming media server). [This American Life][5] remains the only non-musical audio production thats able to keep my attention for a full hour.

LugRadio definitely isn&#8217;t geared soley for the hardcore open source geek. Casual open source users should feel right at home as well.

<small>There&#8217;s plenty of swearing, so you may not want to listen to it at work without headphones.</small>
