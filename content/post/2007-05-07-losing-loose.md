[![Losing Loose][1]][2]

For some reason using loose instead of lose is my #1 pet peeve. Every once in a while the word loose works when used in place of lose, but in this case it makes it sound like Apple wants labels to let loose even more DRM upon the world.

And $1.29 per song? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me. I&#8217;ll order a DRM-free high quality CD instead&#8230; or just keep getting all of my music from [emusic.com][3] which has never had DRM.
