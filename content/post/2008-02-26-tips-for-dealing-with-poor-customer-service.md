[A comment on my blog][1] has inspired me to quick post a few tips I&#8217;ve picked up for dealing with customer service at large companies. I&#8217;m in the middle of a battle with Comcast right now because the reliability of my Internet connection is abysmal.

  1. <div style="float:left;padding:0px 3px;">

    **Keep it short.** Customer service/support reps are more likely to be rewarded for keeping calls short than they are for resolving customer issues. So take a tip from Republicans: work up a few brief talking points and keep driving them home until they resolve your issue.</li>

        </div>
        
        Try to figure out how to **get your issue escalated.** In my experience there are always multiple levels of support with the first level simply reading and responding to a small number of scripts.
  
        I&#8217;ve found that having a detailed piece of technical information can break the scripts and get me escalated to &#8220;Tier II&#8221; or &#8220;Network Specialists&#8221; or some other random title.</li> 
        
          * <div style="float:left;padding:0px 3px;">
              <img src="http://michael.susens-schurter.com/files/dialog-warning.png" alt="Warning Sign" />
            </div>
            
            **Learn what _not_ to say.** With ISPs don&#8217;t mention VPNs, hosting services via your connection, or using 3rd party SMTP servers. While completely legitimate uses of broadband, they often fall into a broad range of &#8220;unsupported&#8221; uses. Worst case scenario, the rep will blame that unsupported activity for all of your issues and refuse to help you further.</li> 
            
              * <div style="float:left;padding:0px 3px;">
                  <img src="http://michael.susens-schurter.com/files/face-devilish.png" alt="Devil Face" />
                </div>
                
                **Know when to _lie_.** This is closely related to the previous point. I use Linux, but I always say I use Windows. ISPs often only support _a single computer directly connected to your broadband modem_. Just lie, but make sure you have access to any administrative interface your modem might have.*</li> 
                
                  * <div style="float:left;padding:0px 3px;">
                      <img src="http://michael.susens-schurter.com/files/face-smile.png" alt="Smiling Face" />
                    </div>
                    
                    **Be friendly, chances are they hate their job.** This can be tough to do especially when the poor rep just wants to get rid of you ASAP so he/she can go on break. I&#8217;ve found making little self-deprecating jokes about being a &#8220;pain in the ass customer&#8221; or asking permission to lie when asked those stupid questions like &#8220;have you tried rebooting?&#8221;. This tip may help you get escalated as well.</li> 
                    
                      * <div style="float:left;padding:0px 3px;">
                          <img src="http://michael.susens-schurter.com/files/face-sad.png" alt="Sad Face" />
                        </div>
                        
                        **Be careful when bluffing.** I&#8217;ve threatened to quit a service before only to have the rep say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to here that sir, have a nice day.&#8221; I don&#8217;t even think she was cleverly calling my bluff; she just saw the opportunity to end the call! If you&#8217;re going to make a threat make it something that actually makes life difficult for them like talking to their manager or getting a full refund.
  
                        Still, try the friendly approach first. Remember you&#8217;re talking to real people who probably hate the company your dealing with more than you!</li> 
                        
                          * <div style="float:left;padding:0px 3px;">
                              <img src="http://michael.susens-schurter.com/files/network-error.png" alt="Network Error" />
                            </div>
                            
                            **Finally, don&#8217;t forget: _it could be your fault._** Reset your modem. Reset your router. Actually try Internet Explorer instead of Firefox when they ask you.
  
                            My best example of this is when I pestered a poor customer rep for 15 minutes trying to figure out and then reset my password only to find out I needed to type a full e-mail address as the username instead of just the username part. I had the correct password all along. Luckily the rep was very nice about it.</li> </ol> 
                            
                            * My cable modem&#8217;s administrative interface is accessible at [192.168.100.1][2] which seems standard for cable modems. My home network&#8217;s subnet is 192.168.1.1, so my router happily just treats my modem like any other Internet site. This is a great way to be able to &#8220;prove&#8221; to reps that you&#8217;re &#8220;directly connected&#8221; to your modem.
