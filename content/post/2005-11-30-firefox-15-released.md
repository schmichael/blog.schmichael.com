Remember to drop by [Mozilla.com][1] and pick up Firefox 1.5. Here are some of my favorite points:

  * Better pop-up blocking.
  * Faster back & forward buttons. Much faster!
  * Moveable tabs! You can now drag & move your tabs (without having to install an extension).
  * Builtin SVG support. SVG images are vector based (think logos & maps). While not many sites use them now, its an exciting technology with many practical applications.

My gripes:

  * Fails [Acid2][2] test.
  * [Adobe&#8217;s SVG demos][3] fail miserably.
  * Why is the X button to close tabs still on the far right instead of on each tab like Epiphany? Time to go looking for an extension or theme to fix this&#8230;
