Next week I&#8217;ll be leaving [Lo-Fi Art][1] to start working for [YouGov Polimetrix][2] (aka PMX). For the past couple of years I&#8217;ve been consulting with Chris Pitzer mostly as a Python web developer specializing in Django. It will be sad to stop working for a company I own with a friend, but I&#8217;ve been working part time for PMX and am excited to work for them full time.

There are many reasons for my decision, but I should make it clear that it has nothing to do with Chris! It has been great working with him, and I&#8217;m glad we get to continue to share office space even if we&#8217;re working on different things. There is _plenty_ of client work stacking up for him to do as well, so I&#8217;m not bailing on a sinking ship.

**So why am I leaving Lo-Fi Art?**

The biggest reason is probably stress. I&#8217;ve just stopped enjoying client work because if I&#8217;m not stressed about getting the current client done on time, I&#8217;m stressed about finding the next client. If its not one of those two things, I&#8217;m probably stressed about when the next check is coming in. How much was it for again? Wait, did I already get that one? Argh! On top of that I&#8217;m _terrible_ at managing money. While Chris does a great job with the company books, that doesn&#8217;t keep me from screwing up my own (don&#8217;t even ask me about how my tax return went this year).

On top of that, contracting gigs just have a lot of **overhead**. For me overhead is anything that keeps me from writing code. I really don&#8217;t enjoy writing proposals and meeting with clients to discuss (or often: haggle over) implementation details. Its not that I don&#8217;t like _people_. I love people! But I like working with a **team** more than a **client**.

Some people really thrive in the consulting world. I think its just taken me years to realize I&#8217;m not one of those people. I could see returning to consulting someday, but I can&#8217;t imagine it would ever be back to the 2-4 week projects I currently spend most of my time on.

**Why am I joining YouGov Polimetrix?**

I&#8217;ve been a consultant for PMX working on the [BrandIndex][3] project for over a year now, and it was getting to the point where I needed to either commit or focus purely on Lo-Fi work. It was a really hard decision, but in the end PMX just gives me the opportunity to do what I love. I work in a fantastic team* with lots of fun technology in an organization that places high value on their IT resources. What more could I ask for? Oh yeah, a steady paycheck. That was a plus too. ðŸ˜‰
