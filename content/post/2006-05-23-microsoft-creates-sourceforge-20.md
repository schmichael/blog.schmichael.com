Evidently the point of CodePlex is to host and manage open source projects (as well as Microsoft&#8217;s _shared_ source projects). CodePlex has a [Wiki][3] which looks like it will eventually contain useful information, but its pretty sparse right now.

For example, I can&#8217;t find what version control system it uses. The [Wiki references some Team Explorer Client application][4] which can be used to connect to CodePlex projects, but I&#8217;ll leave that up to someone else to play with.

This is obviously a direct competitor to [SourceForge][5], which I must admit needs competitors, but who&#8217;s going to use this site besides Microsoft? From what I can tell its going to try and force you to use Microsoft tools and technologies at every turn.

My guess is that this will just house a bunch of Microsoft&#8217;s shared source projects as well as a few other projects from Microsoft partners and MVPs. I can&#8217;t imagine any self-respecting open source project actually migrating to a Microsoft controlled project management system.

(And what&#8217;s with the name? Reminds me a lot of [_Google_plex][6], which I&#8217;m sure makes [Steve Ballmer][7] happy.)
