I tendered my resignation at [Tremont District #702 Schools][1] today.

In 2 weeks I&#8217;ll start working full time for [the IT consultancy I started with Chris Pitzer, **Lo-Fi Art, LLC**][2].* While we mostly specialize in web design and development, I&#8217;ll be doing quite a bit of system and network administration at a (different) school at least at first.

Expect lots of posts on this topic in the near future. I haven&#8217;t been this excited in a long time, and I&#8217;ve never been this excited about _work_.

So [send your RFPs my way][3]! We&#8217;d love to help.

<small>* Yeah our own web site isn&#8217;t even up yet. But no one pays us to do that. ðŸ˜‰</small>
