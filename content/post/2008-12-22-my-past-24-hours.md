**Sunday, December 21st**

The plan is the not chance the weather and stay overnight at the airport tonight to make sure to catch our 6:30am flight Monday morning. Here&#8217;s what happened:

  * 9:00am &#8211; 4:45pm &#8211; Packing, checking Trimet service alerts and flight cancellations.
  * 4:45pm &#8211; 6:00pm &#8211; Waiting at bus stop for a bus that never came. Met a cool guy named Rob though
  * 6:20pm &#8211; Home, get call from US Airways our flight is canceled.
  * 6:30pm &#8211; Power goes out.
  * 7:00pm &#8211; 9:00pm &#8211; I go on a hike. Notice my wedding ring is missing. Spend next hour hiking and digging through snow looking for it.
  * 10pm &#8211; Go to bed depressed, but quite warm in our sleeping bags under every blanket we own.

**Monday**

  * 9:00am &#8211; Get up, still no power.
  * 10:00am &#8211; 12:00am &#8211; Get crazy idea to try to make it to the Pitzer&#8217;s in the Focus. Took 15 minutes to thaw the car and drive 15&#8242; to our house. Took almost 2 hours of the greatest neighbor in the world helping put my chains back on about a dozen times just to get my car parked in front of our house.  
    Pitzer&#8217;s house is not going to happen.
  * 1:00pm &#8211; Power is back! Yay! Now we just have to figure out how to save Christmas&#8230;

The best part is that the PGE (utility company) truck showed up at about 11:45am at which point my car was stuck chainless in the middle of the road.
