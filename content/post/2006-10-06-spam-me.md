My good friend [Dan Coulter][1] set me up with an e-mail account to test [DreamHost][2]&#8216;s spam filtering. If you&#8217;re not a spammer, you can stop reading this post now. <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  
So please send all of your pharmacy advertisements, stock tips, and other spam to:

**Update:** Removed e-mail. Testing has been over for a long time. ðŸ˜‰
