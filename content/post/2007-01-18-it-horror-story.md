Instant messages from a friend who I&#8217;m sure would blog this but can&#8217;t for obvious reasons:

<font size="2"><font color="#cc0000"><strong><font size="3">Steve:</font></strong></font><font size="3"> I&#8217;m making an emergency run to best buy for someone because they need 6 UPSs and they won&#8217;t make it in time</font><br /> <font color="#cc0000"><strong><font size="3">Steve:</font></strong></font><font size="3"> and I&#8217;m going to spend $1200 of my own money and someone will meet me with cash in a town 40 miles west of me (the best buy is 40 miles east of me and closes in an hour)</font><br /> <font color="#cc0000"><strong><font size="3">Steve:</font></strong></font><font size="3"> he works for a bank and it is apparently for them</font><br /> <font color="#cc0000"><strong><font size="3">Steve:</font></strong></font><font size="3"> the cash exchange will happen in a gas station parking lot</font></font>

<font size="2">And that my friends is how IT in the banking industry works: money exchanged in the parking lot of gas stations for consumer grade equipment thats bound to be put in a mission critical position.</font>

<font size="2">Steve, you know who you are, and you know what <a href="http://www.thedailywtf.com">site to submit your story to</a>. <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </font>
