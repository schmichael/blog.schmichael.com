Ars Technica has [an article describing Microsoft Windows Vista&#8217;s &#8220;Anytime Upgrade&#8221; feature][1]. In the patent for the technology Microsoft describes it as &#8220;modular OS updates.&#8221;

So far it sounds like Microsoft got a clue from Linux and Apple: users want timely, incremental updates. Not years of silence followed by a monolithic change.

&#8220;Modular OS updates&#8221; sound exactly like packages and package managers in Linux distributions. Both systems even have facilities to verify the updates. However, in Microsoft&#8217;s case the verification isn&#8217;t to protect the user like [Linux does with checksums and GPG keys][2]. With Microsoft the verification is to make sure you&#8217;ve paid for the extra bloat you&#8217;re installing.
