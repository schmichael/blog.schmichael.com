Evidently, [I&#8217;m helping spread FUD about PHP6][1] because I linked to [Rasmus&#8217;s post about PHP6][2].

I have to admit, I&#8217;m a bit confused by [Tobias Schlitt&#8217;s][3] assertion that &#8220;I [Tobias] concider it harmful to bring those discussions to the wide public, which might spread FUD to actual PHP users.&#8221; That bothers me on a number of levels. Not only does it seem counter to the very nature of open source software development, but it also seems like a slap in the face to the PHP community. You can&#8217;t trust your users with knowledge concerning the future of your project?

I don&#8217;t mean to be disrespectful, and honestly, I can imagine that PHP developers face a lot of erroneous &#8220;press&#8221; coverage. But please don&#8217;t discourage the dissemination of knowledge.

**Update:** At 12:20 last night/this morning it was easy to feel very idealistic towards Tobias&#8217;s post. However, after his kind post and update, I understand his pragmatism and realize that PHP6 is so far off that there&#8217;s little point in getting everyone all worked up over a few vague ideas on a wishlist.

I just hope I didn&#8217;t prove your point for you Tobias. ðŸ˜‰
