Just skimmed an [article on El Reg about Office 2007&#8217;s expected slow uptake][1].Â  The school I work for is currently in the process of upgrading from Office 2000 to Office 2003.Â  I can&#8217;t imagine why we&#8217;d want to upgrade to Office 2007 in the next few years.Â  Office 2003 already offers very few benefits over 2000 and feels much slower.

Office 2007 really seems like a great excuse for my school to try [OpenOffice][2].
