[Havoc Pennington has a great post entitled Which Piece of Big Government Are You Against?][1]

War on Terror + DoD ~= 21.6% of our budget. I know we can&#8217;t cut it all, but a guy can dream can&#8217;t he? <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

My favorite line is in regards to how different political parties approach budgetary spending:

> Republicans and Democrats judged by actions not rhetoric: government should be 105% of whatever it just was. Disagreement on where the new 5% goes.

So true. [Neither party has been fiscally conservative (or even responsible) for the past 30 years.][2] The Republicans just spend more on bombs while the Dems spend it on _evil_ socialist programs like welfare.

<small>Emphasis added to denote sarcasm.</small>

I&#8217;d much rather my tax dollars paid for some poor person&#8217;s laziness (as many conservatives see welfare) than have it spent bombing the same country into oblivion twice in a bit over a decade.

It is sad to see us throw away 9% of our federal budget on interest payments. Hopefully our economy will recover quickly enough for President Obama to start paying back the deficit like Clinton did in the 90s.
