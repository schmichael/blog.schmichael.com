The [little recipe I posted][1] for a dedicated Linux firewall with a CherryPy powered administrative interface finally has a [permanent home over at Google Code][2].

Many thanks to Kyle Waremburg for creating the project page and helping me develop [firewall-admin][2]! I hope other people find it useful.
