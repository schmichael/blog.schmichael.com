[Linux Today has an excellent article][1] on the [One Laptop Per Child initiatives XO laptop][2].

While the technology is innovative and revolutionary, my concern has always been that the $100+ cost of the laptop would be better spent on more traditional educational materials. However, this article begins to shed light on how OLPC is addressing that: this laptop is designed to replace text books, paper, pencils, and blackboards in a renewable way.

I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on an XO someday!Â  Its exactly what the public school I work at needs for the vast majority of its computer usage!
