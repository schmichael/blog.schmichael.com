[Slashdot linked][1] to a [Canadian researcher&#8217;s blog about how Web 3.0 (the Semantic Web) won&#8217;t happen][2] because its even more susceptible to the greedy nature of corporations than Web 2.0.

My favorite part however was this one-liner toward the end:

> The future of the web will be based on <span style="font-style: italic">personal</span> computing.

In the age where cell phones, game consoles, and iPods are only getting more popular, that&#8217;s a bold statement to make.

However, no matter what companies like to say about &#8220;[The Network Is the Computer][3]&#8220;, take away PCs and you&#8217;re left with, literally, a bunch of networked toys. Despite consumer electronics seeming move toward specialized devices, the PC remains the real workhorse.

(To be fair, take the network away from the PC and you lose a lot of power. I&#8217;m not trying to say the network isn&#8217;t vitally important. Its just easy to forget the primacy of the PC in a world where rounded cornered web sites and white gadgets get all of the attention.)

While I don&#8217;t expect the PC to dominate the IT landscape forever, it won&#8217;t be taken down by [buzzwords][4], [web gimmicks][5]*, and [throw away gadgets][6].
