Looks like [Synthesys][1] is part of [a larger movement where IT jobs are spring up in rural America][2]. For anyone who happens across this blog that isn&#8217;t familiar with Synthesys, we&#8217;re located in [Greenville, IL][3], which is about 45 minutes from St. Louis, MO.

We&#8217;ve been (happily) shocked at the amount of IT work we&#8217;ve found in a town of 8,000. While [HPUGOA][4] is an out of town customer, most of our other business is local. We&#8217;ve built two custom commercial applications for local organizations. One is [Bid-Advantage][5], and the other is just about to be released to the public.

Living in Greenville definitely helps to keep the costs down, but has one major disadvantage: what is my Art Major wife supposed to do?
