Growing up, going to college, and then working for a couple of years in rural Illinois, BPL (Broadband over Powerlines) was always a technology I watched with eager anticipation.

Unfortunately sometime in [2005 I realized Duke Nukem Forever and Perl 6 had better chances of seeing the light of day than BPL.][1]

Today I got confirmation that not only is BPL not-gonna-happen, but it quietly died when no one was looking:

> Jones said these utility-built networks are &#8220;just not panning out like utilities were expecting.&#8221; Broadband over powerline is one example, where existing infrastructure could be leveraged to combine broadband to the home and smart metering services. However, there&#8217;s no successful large-scale BPL rollout anywhere in the world after a decade of trying.

From the Ars Technica article [
  
AT&T plugs into grid, powers smart meters&#8217; conversations][2].

The article is all about utilities turning to AT&T for data connectivity to electrical meters. That task was supposed to be Job 1 for BPL. The one feature it could actually offer to utilities to convince them that [becoming an ISP wasn&#8217;t _entirely_ outside their business model.][3]

**Anyone have a copy of the obituary?**

While in [2005 Google and Goldman Sachs were pumping money into BPL][4], I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen it mentioned in the news in at least a couple of years.

So did I miss the funeral, or is there some BPL company promising a just-around-the-corner breakthrough to _finally_ make BPL an option?
