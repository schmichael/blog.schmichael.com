10. All the time. I program in PHP after all.
  
8. Well it did!
  
7. I use open source, the point release subrevision difference must be what&#8217;s causing the bug!
  
6. [Testing is for the weak.][3]
  
4. And run Spybot, Adaware, and Hijack This?
  
2. End users are crazy.
  
1. Followed by &#8220;Maybe I just didn&#8217;t commit it.&#8221; which is followed by &#8220;Huh, I guess not. Must have forgotten to fix it.&#8221;
