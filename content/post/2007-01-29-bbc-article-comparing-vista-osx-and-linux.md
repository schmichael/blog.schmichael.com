The BBC has [an excellent article where 4 users describe their favorite operating system][1]. It seems extremely balanced and accurate to me. Although I can&#8217;t help but point out one Windows user&#8217;s admission that OSX is better:

> I really think that this one&#8217;s going to give Apple Macs a run for their money.

It appears Office 2007 and Vista come with my school&#8217;s Volume Licensing package, so I plan on dual-booting into my Windows XP partition for the first time in months to try them out. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re both improvements over their predecessors, but at this point I&#8217;m just more comfortable with Linux and OpenOffice.org.

Also, spending half of my day running Windows Update and various spyware removal tools has made me despise the platform more than [Steve Ballmer&#8217;s ridiculous tirades][2] ever could.
