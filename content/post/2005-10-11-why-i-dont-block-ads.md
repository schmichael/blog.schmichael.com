Laziness mainly.

Slashdot had [an article today asking people to comment on why they block ads.][1] I don&#8217;t block Internet ads.

Part of the reason is that I&#8217;ve just never gotten around to installing AdBlock even though I hate it when simple Flash banner ads bring my Firefox to a crawl.

The other part of the reason is because I want to support the sites I visit, and as a cheap jerk, I don&#8217;t want to have to shell money out of my own pocket to support them.

I also find ads useful sometimes. Oddly enough, even though I love Google, I&#8217;ve **never** found their text ads helpful, interesting, or even relevant! Often times they&#8217;re just funny.

In fact I discovered the hosting company that this site is running on, [Linode][2], through a banner ad on [KernelTrap][3].
