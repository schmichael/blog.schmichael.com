Its probably been 10+ years since I&#8217;ve touched IRC. In the early days of the public Internet, IRC was IM + MySpace + Filesharing, only a lot geekier. <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Then came ICQ and soon after a flood of IM clients that rendered IRC clumsy and antiquated for casual chatting. When I went from High School to College in 2000, I left IRC behind&#8230;

Now its 2007, I&#8217;m an old man and returning to my old ways. I&#8217;m back on IRC except instead of chatting with friends using [pIRCh][1]* on Windows 98, I&#8217;m lurking in technical channels using [irsii][2] centrally located on a [Debian Etch][3] server.

If you want to track me down I go by the nick **schmichael**** and am currently lurking in the following channels.

  * `#cherrypy` on irc.oftc.net
  * `#linode` on irc.oftc.net
  * `#python-genshi` on irc.freenode.net
  * `#drupal-ecommerce` on irc.freenode.net

I also pop in and out of `#gnome` on [gimpnet][4] and `#drupal-support` on irc.freenode.net.

To experienced free and open source software community members the fact that IRC is new or strange to anyone is probably a bit hard to grasp. As far as I can tell, IRC is simply the de facto method for communicating about FOSS projects. Mailing lists may be more popular for some projects, but I find the instance gratification of IRC much more appealing.

<small>* I remember liking its scripting better then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC">mIRC</a> or some such nonsense&#8230; I&#8217;ve never been known to use the most popular software available&#8230;</p>
