An article from [El Reg about MySQL][1] ends with a great quote:

> This is the same lesson that Debian hasn&#8217;t yet learned from Ubuntu: fast and good-enough always beats slow and correct.

Release [Lenny][2] now!

**Update:** Yay! It appears [Debian has voted that binary firmware blobs in the Linux kernel are GPL compatible][3] unless explicitly proven otherwise! AFAIK this is in line with Linus&#8217;s reasoning as well. Regardless of the &#8220;law,&#8221; end users benefit greatly from these blobs, and this means Lenny will hopefully be released much sooner than if another option had won!

<small>The poor thing [Lenny] is already out of date (Old version of OpenOffice.org, 2 versions old on the kernel now, a version behind with Gnome, even further behind with KDE I believe, etc.)</small>
