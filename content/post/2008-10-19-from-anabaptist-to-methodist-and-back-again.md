My wife, Samantha, and I attended [Portland Mennonite Church][1] for their Sunday morning service today. The singing was beautiful.[1] The sermon excellent.[2] And the potluck: classic.[3] Ironically within seconds of nervously taking a seat at potluck someone mentions going to Central Illinois for a wedding, and we discovered someone else&#8217;s wife went to the same tiny summer camp in Minnesota as Sam.

However, the real irony was in the fact that I found myself enjoying an Anabaptist service. To understand this you have to know a bit of Schurter family lore:

My father grew up United Methodist, swore it off and joined a [Apostolic Christian Church][2], and in the past few years has gone back to a [United Methodist Church][3].

I grew up in the Apostolic church, went off to college and became [Methodist][4] (Free, then United), and now I&#8217;m back at an Anabaptist church (albeit Mennonite instead of German Apostolic).

I guess I should clarify Sam & I haven&#8217;t joined the Portland Mennonite Church, but we&#8217;re definitely planning on going back!

<small>1. I&#8217;m a sucker for hymns and actual multi-part harmonies. This was only my second time experience Mennonite singing, but both times have been the best congregational singing I&#8217;ve ever heard.</small>

<small>2. It was on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Talents">Parable of the Talents</a>. The pastor managed to speak frankly both about the current financial crisis and our responsibility to do good (the true meaning of the parable poorly summed up in a sentence fragment&#8230;sorry).</small>

<small>3. Lots of casseroles (&#8220;hotdish&#8221; in Minnesotan).</small>
