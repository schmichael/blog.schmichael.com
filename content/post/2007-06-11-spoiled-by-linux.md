Besides dual-booting for the occasional game, I use Linux exclusively at home and work. Every once in a while I&#8217;m forced to try and get some real work done in Windows XP. I don&#8217;t see how anyone can stand it. Here are a few of the things I can&#8217;t stand when working in Windows:

  1. **No [virtual desktops/workspaces][1].** This is a deal breaker for me. I like keeping my application windows tidy and well organized. This is impossible on Windows where they&#8217;re all forced onto a single desktop and eventually my taskbar becomes an unusable mess of 3 word titles.
  2. **No built-in SSH support.** I love [PuTTY][2] and [WinSCP][3], but I hate having to download those 2 programs just to get part of the functionality built into Linux. In Gnome I can mount remote filesystems via SSH and work directly off of the remote computer with most Gnome applications.
  3. **No [Synaptic][4].** Packages have spoiled me. Installing software in Windows is a chore compared to the simple 3 step process of using Synaptic: 1. Open Synaptic, 2. Select package to install, 3. Click Apply. Using apt-get is even faster, and Ubuntu&#8217;s Add/Remove Programs makes things even easier.
  
    Speaking of Add/Remove Programs, has anyone ever _added_ programs using the Windows control panel applet? I guess it can add Windows applications, but the name is still misleading.
  4. [**Ctrl-alt-del to login**][5]. You really need to watch the whole video.
  5. **No virtual consoles.** Not a huge issue really, but it sure would make living without workspaces easier.
  6. **[Nerfed][6] command line.** While [PowerShell][7] does sounds exciting, DOS is weak and frustrating to try and work in.
  7. **Notepad**. After 15 years Microsoft&#8217;s default text editor still can&#8217;t do the simplest things like handle Unix/Mac line endings.
  8. **Manually installing drivers.** Besides having to manually install proprietary video drivers, I haven&#8217;t had to touch a driver in Linux in years. Granted installing drivers in Linux can be much more difficult than Windows due to hardware vendors focusing their support on the dominant OS. However doing a fresh Windows XP install always requires me digging out driver CDs or poking around support web sites trying to find the right drivers. What a pain.
  9. **Windows Update**. It should be illegal to update an operating system via a web browser. This is so counter-intuitive I don&#8217;t feel like I need to point out my issues with it. In fact, I hear in Vista they&#8217;ve done away with using Internet Explorer to run Windows Update.
 10. **Drive letters and backslashes.**Â  I wonder what possessed the original DOS developers to use a backslash as a path separator&#8230;Â  The forward slash is right there by my pinky, begging to be used.

**Note:** I have very little experience with Vista, so maybe some of these points have been addressed. I&#8217;m sure all of these points can be addressed through 3rd party applications, but I really don&#8217;t want to waste time sorting through volumes of malware just to find the few good apps needed to make Windows work well.
