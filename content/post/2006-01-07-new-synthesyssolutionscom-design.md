On Thursday I helped Tony upload the new [Synthesys Solutions][1] home page. We replaced our old custom built PHP site with [Drupal][2]. There are still a few kinks to work out &#8211; such as not mentioning [OpenIT][3]! &#8211; but for the most part I&#8217;m excited to finally have a powerful CMS driving our home page.
