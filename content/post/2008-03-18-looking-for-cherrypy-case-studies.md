At the [CherryPy][1] [BOF][2][1] at [Pycon in Chicago][3] we discussed how people are using CherryPy in lots of different ways. We&#8217;re afraid people aren&#8217;t grokking how flexible CherryPy is just by briefly glancing at the web site and thought having some interesting case studies would be useful.

The [wiki has a good start][4]. However, its a bit out of date, and it&#8217;d be nice to have some great Case Studies as well as a separate list of Projects using CherryPy.

If your company deploys CherryPy or you&#8217;ve used CherryPy for a client, I&#8217;d love to hear the story. Here&#8217;s a basic format you could follow:

  1. **Who** is using CherryPy: (your name)
  2. **Where** are you using Cherrypy?
      
    (Company or client name. You can of course remain anonymous)
  3. **What** do you do with CherryPy?
      
    (What&#8217;s your project: a traditional public web site? internal web services?)
  4. **How** is CherryPy deployed?
     
    (Behind modproxy/modpython/modwsgi, on a cluster behind a load balancer, or is it your frontend HTTP server?)
  5. **How long** have you used CherryPy?
      
    (The &#8220;when&#8221; question)
  6. **Why** did you choose CherryPy?
      
    (While &#8220;because its the best&#8221; is obviously the answer, a little more detail would be nice. ðŸ˜‰ )

Feel free to include screenshots, links, code snippets, diagrams, etc, and **[e-mail me!][5]**

With [3.1 nearing release][6], it&#8217;d be nice if we could launch an updated version of the web site at the same time, so your help is greatly appreciated!
