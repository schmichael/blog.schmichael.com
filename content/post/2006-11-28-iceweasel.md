I upgraded from Debian Etch to Sid today and part of the upgrade included the transition from Firefox to Iceweasel.Â  Iceweasel is a re-branded version of Firefox to get around trademark issues.Â  The only functional difference I can see is that all of the built-in update features are disabled in favor of Debian&#8217;s packaging system.

I just pray no one notices because I really don&#8217;t want to have to explain why my browser, which looks like the beloved Firefox, says _Iceweasel_ at the top.Â  Its just silly and embarrassing.
