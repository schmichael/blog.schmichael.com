On Nov 1st 2006, I left my position as the lead Developer at Synthesys Solutions to become a lowly assistant Computer Technician at Tremont School District #702.

While there are a number of reasons for the switch, the #1 reason was **I wasn&#8217;t happy coding all day**. I never wanted to be a code monkey, and working from home only made the position more isolating and dull.

In my first two days of employment at Tremont I&#8217;ve had the satisfaction of fixing 2 printers, 1 sound card, improving e-mail for 3 users, installing new software for over half a dozen users, fixing a long standing issue with the antivirus server, and probably some other tasks I&#8217;m forgetting.

While watching installation progress bars isn&#8217;t exactly a party, the gratification from making someone&#8217;s life easier with 10 minutes of work is incredibly satisfying. As a programmer, I could spend days hacking up an ugly solution to a difficult problem and never have time to do things right. Removing spyware may be boring and kind of suck, but the user&#8217;s reaction when their computer runs 100x faster makes it all worth it.

To be honest this new job isn&#8217;t entirely a demotion. **I would never have taken it if I thought all of my days would be spent running Windows Update and upgrading Office.** Hopefully in the near future you&#8217;ll see me blogging about:

  * A Linux Gateway/Firewall/VPN solution
  * Replacing Exchange with <span style="font-style: italic">anything else!</span>
  * Migrating from Internet Explorer to Firefox
  * Using Linux file servers
  * Setting up some Linux workstations

And my ultimate goal:
  
<span style="font-style: italic" /><span style="font-weight: bold">Migrating 500 computers from Windows to Linux.</span>

I&#8217;ll keep you posted. ðŸ˜‰
