While doing some preliminary research on a CS2 C# textbook, I found a [great paper comparing Java and C# for use in CS1 and CS2 courses][1].

I was impressed with how well C# faired against Java considering Java is quite popular in the academic world. And one of the authors points _against_ C# &#8211; its lack of cross/multi-platform support &#8211; is addressed by the [exciting Mono project][2].

(In case you didn&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m an adjunct professor at Greenville College. I taught CIS210 in the Fall (a CS1 class) and will be teaching CIS211 (CS2) in the Spring.)
