Just noticed my first post appeared on [Unofficial Planet Python][1].

**Hello all!**

If you&#8217;re really bored, you can [learn more about me][2] or [read all of my posts][3].

Suffice it to say I&#8217;m a new Python consultant. Monday, October 15th, was my last day at my old job, and I&#8217;m very excited to be starting a new web development company, Lo-Fi Art, with my friend Chris Pitzer! (No links because I&#8217;m really not trying to shamelessly advertise, I&#8217;m just excited!)

At any rate, thanks to [Christian Wyglendowski][4] for introducing me to Python and now getting me on the Unoffical Planet Python!

I come from a PHP (with some .NET) background, so I&#8217;m sorry if my posts seem simple or mundane to experienced Pythoners. I can&#8217;t help it if the beautiful simplicity of Python is exciting to a PHP/.NET refugee. ðŸ˜‰
