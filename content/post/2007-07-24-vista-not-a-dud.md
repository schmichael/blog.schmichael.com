&#8230;[its just irrelevant][1]. The operating system you use doesn&#8217;t matter much anymore, and arguably it shouldn&#8217;t.

I&#8217;m not defending Vista. In fact it seems like the perfect example of how Microsoft doesn&#8217;t understand where the computer industry is headed.

By the time Windows 7 is released the operating system _should_ just be a minor personal preference like choosing Gnome vs. KDE.

Of course video games and specialized software will keep people on Windows. Luckily at least specialized software is migrating to the web very quickly. Video games will hopefully become more cross-platform in order to remain popular in a world where there&#8217;s actual competition in the operating system world.

<small>I haven&#8217;t posted in a long time, and this is a really lame way to start posting again&#8230; expect some much more interesting posts in the near future.</small>
