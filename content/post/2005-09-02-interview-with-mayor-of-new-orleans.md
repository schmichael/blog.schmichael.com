In addition to the amazing blog I mentioned earlier, there&#8217;s an [excellent interview with the Mayor of New Orleans.][1] I believe the law or precedent they keep referring to as causing problems is the Posse Comitatus Act. Which if the [Wikipedia article][2] on the subject is correct should not apply at all.

At least a couple of the exceptions listed should apply. However, I&#8217;m not positive this is what they&#8217;re referring to, and my blogging about it isn&#8217;t going to get the federal government moving any faster.

I want to see the entire Bush administration finally have to pay for their gross negligence. I want to see America open its eyes to the plight of the impoverished.

Unfortunately I&#8217;m afraid this is going to be business as usual. The government will spin, the media outlets will lose interest once the looters are gone, and America will return to being ignorant of its problems.
