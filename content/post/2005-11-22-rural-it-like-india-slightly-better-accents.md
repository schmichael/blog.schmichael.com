Wired News is running a great article on [outsourcing to Rural IT companies.][1]

If you missed [my previous post about an ABC News story on the same subject][2], Synthesys is one of these rural IT consulting companies. We&#8217;re quite similar to the company mentioned in the Wired News article except we&#8217;re smaller. Even the price range listed in the article is pretty close to our own.

At Synthesys we rely heavily on **free and open source software** to give our customers a sense of security about dealing with a small business. Even if Synthesys should up & disappear someday (God forbid!), our clients could simply get support from another company because all the source is available.

I hope other small IT businesses do the same because it strengthens the entire industry through healthy competition and transparency.
