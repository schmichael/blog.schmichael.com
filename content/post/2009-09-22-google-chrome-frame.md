I maintain a web application that must support Internet Explorer 6, so I was delighted to hear about [Google Chrome Frame][1].

Unfortunately their warnings of its alpha status seem to be well founded. The 2 show-stoppers I ran into fairly quickly were:

  1. Flash is difficult to install. (Tip: Try visiting: <cf:http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/>)
  2. The Location bar did not always change to reflect the current page.

I&#8217;ll definitely be following this project closely as it may allow corporate users stuck on IE to use a different browser relatively easily.
