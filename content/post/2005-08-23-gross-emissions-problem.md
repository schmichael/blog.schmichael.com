If you think the title of this post sounds disgusting, so do I. My car&#8217;s in the shop to get new tires* and to check out why the &#8220;Check Engine&#8221; light is on. The mechanic&#8217;s explanation was that my car has a &#8220;gross emissions problem.&#8221; I really regret not asking him if that was something I could fix with [Beano][1]&#8230;

* Sadly my wife won&#8217;t let me get [sweet rims][2] for our Ford Focus.**

** Piece of crap domestic car&#8230;

**Update:** Evidently &#8220;gross emissions problem&#8221; = &#8220;malfunctioning gas cap&#8221; &#8211; which, luckily, will cost under $50; which, unluckily, is the deductible on our warranty.
