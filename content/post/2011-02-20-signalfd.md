_This article covers_ signalfd_, a system call only available on Linux. If anyone knows of an equivalent for OSX or BSDs,<abbrev title="If there's something like signalfd for Windows, I'm sorry but I really couldn't care less.">*</abbrev> please [let me know][1]. It&#8217;d be great to create a compatibility layer._

Writing asynchronous IO code is fun; handling signals is not. [signalfd][2] allows you to move your signal handling code into your main event loop instead of hooking up global handlers and using the featureless [set\_wakeup\_fd][3] function to break the main loop.

Luckily [Jean-Paul Calderone had already created a great Python wrapper for the signalfd and sigprocmask system calls][4]. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t include a way to parse the siginfo_t structure which contains all the useful information about the signal you&#8217;re handling.

I&#8217;ve added a helper to do just that in a branch:

<https://code.launchpad.net/~schmichael/python-signalfd/helpers>

A sample program would look like:

<pre lang="python">import os
import select
import signal

import signalfd


def sigfdtest():
    # Catch them all!
    sigs = []
    for attr in dir(signal):
        if attr.startswith('SIG') and not attr.startswith('SIG_'):
            sigs.append(getattr(signal, attr))

    sfd = signalfd.create_signalfd(sigs)
    print 'Capturing: %r' % sorted(sigs)
    
    while 1:
        print 'selecting - pid: %d' % os.getpid()
        r = select.select([sfd], [], [])[0]
        for s in r:
            assert s is sfd, 'Python nicely re-uses the fd instance'
            sig = signalfd.read_signalfd(sfd)
            print sig
                

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sigfdtest()
</pre>

When run you can throw some signals at it:

<pre>Capturing: [6, 14, 7, 17, 17, 18, 8, 1, 4, 2, 29, 6, 9, 13, 29, 27, 30, 3, 64, 34, 11, 19, 31, 15, 5, 20, 21, 22, 23, 10, 12, 26, 28, 24, 25]
selecting - pid: 6523
^CSIGINT
selecting - pid: 6523
^CSIGINT
selecting - pid: 6523
SIGHUP
selecting - pid: 6523
Killed
</pre>

Of course you&#8217;ll need to use an uninterpretable signal like KILL to exit.

[Jean-Paul attempted to get signalfd included in Python 2.7&#8217;s signal module, and it was slated for inclusion in 3.2][5]. However, given that [3.2][6] was just [released without it][7], I&#8217;m guessing the attempt to get this functionality into Python&#8217;s stdlib has been forgotten.

Up next: [eventfd][8] perhaps?
