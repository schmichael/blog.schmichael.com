So PPK authentication hasn&#8217;t worked for me on SourceForge.net for &#8230; well &#8230; ever. Today, my new hero and best friend, Ari Gordon-Schlosberg, fixed that (bad permissions somehow).

Why am I so excited? Well now I can do CVS commits and updates without pounding in my password everytime. SourceForge just become much easier to use, and OpenIT should be a lot more fun to update.
