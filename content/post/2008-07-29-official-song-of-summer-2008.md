<small>&#8230;according to me at least.</small>

**Update:** Just realized my fancy widgets aren&#8217;t showing up in feeds. Click through if you care.

Thanks to [The Current][1] I found my song for this summer:* 


  
[**Michael Franti & Spearhead &#8211; _Say Hey (I Love You)_**][2]

It was just released today, and the whole album doesn&#8217;t come out until September 9th. Hopefully it will be on eMusic then!

Amazon&#8217;s MP3 player widget broke when I searched for the song, so you&#8217;ll have to make due with 2 other excellent songs I can&#8217;t get out of my head thanks to The Current.

<small>* Yeah I know its pretty late in the summer to be picking a song, but I just hadn&#8217;t heard <i>the</i> one yet. Summer of 2006 was easy with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere_%28album%29">Gnarls Barkley&#8217;s debut</a>, but I don&#8217;t remember what the official song was last year&#8230;</small>
