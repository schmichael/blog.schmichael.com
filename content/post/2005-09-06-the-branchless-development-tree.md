Just released [OpenIT 2.0][1]. We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts before 2.0.1 is required. I&#8217;m eager to get started on 2.1, but we&#8217;ll see what time permits.

I didn&#8217;t branch the OpenIT development &#8220;tree&#8221; in CVS. I hate CVS branching. It scares me &#8211; I admit it! I&#8217;ll move OpenIT out of CVS as soon as SourceForge offers an alternative. Until then OpenIT developers will have to put up with a branchless source tree.

At [Synthesys][2] I recently finished converting all of our CVS repositories to [Subversion][3]. Subversion may not be revolutionary, but it Just Works. Even version control idiots like me can tag, branch, and merge without fear in Subversion.
