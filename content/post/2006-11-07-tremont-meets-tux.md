For a number of good reasons, [Tremont School][1]&#8216;s use the standard Windows Active Directory + Exchange + Windows Workstations infrastructure. Even though I&#8217;m one of those crazy Linux zealots I understand that 1 guy managing 500 machines doesn&#8217;t exactly have time to learn and implement an upstart operating system.

However, now that its 2 guys managing 500 machines, its my goal to start using Linux where appropriate (aka everywhere ðŸ˜‰ ).

I&#8217;ve now done what I&#8217;ve always dreamed of doing: **use Linux as my primary operating system at work.**

Here&#8217;s the my setup:

  * [Debian Etch][2] (tried [Ubuntu Edgy Eft][3], but it felt too&#8230; pretty.)
  * [pam\_winbind + pam\_krb5 for authentication][4]
  * [Evolution][5] for e-mail and calendaring &#8211; **integrates seamlessly with Exchange** including contacts & calendars! I can&#8217;t tell you how impressed with Evolution I am. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why more people don&#8217;t use it instead of [Thunderbird][6]. Evolution even has [Windows support][7] now.
  * [Samba][8] + [CUPS][9] for File and Print Sharing
  * [OpenOffice.org][10] (obviously)

I have also installed [WINE][11] + [IE6][12] thinking that I might try to install MS Office in the future just so I use the same productivity suite as everyone else, but so far I haven&#8217;t needed to worry about it.
