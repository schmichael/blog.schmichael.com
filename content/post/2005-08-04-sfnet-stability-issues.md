[Looks like][1] I&#8217;d better hurry and get OpenIT 2.0-RC2 out before August 9th.

I have to admit, I&#8217;m a bit frustrated with SourceForge.net. I appreciate the service they provide, but it seems like the number of ads keeps increasing while the level of service stays the same (at best!). To make matters worse [I can&#8217;t get SSH keys to work with developer CVS access][2]. My keys work when logging into shell.sf.net, but I&#8217;m still prompted for my password when using CVS.

In the office we&#8217;ve switched nearly all of our projects from CVS to [Subversion][3], and we couldn&#8217;t be happier.
