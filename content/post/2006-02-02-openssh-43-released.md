The [release notes][1] for the new version of [OpenSSH][2] are far too modest:

> <pre>This is primarily a bug-fix release, only one new feature has been added:</pre>
> 
> <pre>* Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a connection...</pre>

Basically this means OpenSSH is now a full VPN solution. While its only supported in Linux and some BSDs right now, I&#8217;ll be excited to see where this technology goes.
