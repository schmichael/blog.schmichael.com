I&#8217;ve been googling to try and find information on implementing an IMAP client (especially in Python). I ran across [a post to the Twisted-Python mailing list which pretty well sums up why there aren&#8217;t any good* IMAP clients in existence][1].

Don&#8217;t expect [CherryMail][2]** to save you anytime soon&#8230;

<small>* Sure Thunderbird and Evolution handle IMAP alright, but you still have to handle them with care.</small>

<small>** My CherryMail post has already made it to the 2nd search result returned for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=uglier+than+squirrelmail&btnG=Search">uglier than squirrelmail</a>&#8220;&#8230; excellent&#8230;***</small>

<small>*** When I&#8217;m frustrated, I get distracted easily and end up blogging with lots of asterisks.</small>
