When Synthesys first decided to go with PostgreSQL as the database for a large web application, I was very excited to get away from our usual reliance on MySQL and move to a _real_ database platform.

Once we figured out the whole MySQL auto_increment vs. [PostgreSQL SERIAL][1], the first thing we really missed in PostgreSQL was the REPLACE statement. I understand why its missing, and it is kind of a hack of a SQL statement (its not in a SQL standard).

Turns out in the [SQL 2003 Standard there is a statement similar to REPLACE called MERGE][2]. Despite PostgreSQL&#8217;s excellent support for standards, they [have not implemented MERGE][3]. I would guess it has something to do with the ambiguity of the statement.

At any rate I still love working with PostgreSQL, and for what its worth [Npgsql is an excellent PostgreSQL connector for Mono/.Net][4]. (Even in RC/Beta state)
