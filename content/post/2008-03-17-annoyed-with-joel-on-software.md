A quote from [Joel on Software&#8217;s latest post on the IE8 standards mode by default][1]:

> &#8230;the way to make a paragraph with small text is <p><small>, but a lot of people wrote <small><p> which is technically incorrect for reasons most web developers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand&#8230;

What?! If you&#8217;re a web developer and you don&#8217;t understand the difference between a block level element (<p>) and an inline element (<small>), you should **get a new job.** **_NOW._**

I stopped reading the article at that point. It was extremely long-winded and treated the reader like a 5 year old (or upper level management perhaps).

Perhaps if managers like Joel Spolsky wouldn&#8217;t set their expectations of technical knowledge so low for their developers, the web would be a tidier place. ðŸ˜‰

<small>Just kidding Joel. But seriously, inline vs. block? Thats like a web developer not knowing the difference between GET and POST.</small>

<small>Also, CSS is preferable to <small>, especially for a whole element like a paragraph. However, if you check out the source to this paragraph, you&#8217;ll see I&#8217;m not exactly a purist myself.</small>
