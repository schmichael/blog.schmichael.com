So my friend [Dan blogged his results][1] from [MyHeritage.com&#8217;s free celebrity facial comparison][2].

Evidently I look Asian because my #1 result was a South Korean actor, Bae Yong-jun.

<img width="72" height="96" id="image107" alt="Bae Yong-jun" src="http://blogs.synthesyssolutions.com/michael/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Bae%20Yong-jun.thumbnail.jpg" />

After that I had a bunch of ties:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center">
      <img width="72" height="96" id="image109" alt="Pope Pius XII" src="http://blogs.synthesyssolutions.com/michael/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Pope%20Pius%20XII.thumbnail.jpg" /><br /> Pope Pius XII
    </td>
    
    <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center">
      <img width="72" height="96" id="image108" alt="Linus Torvalds" src="http://blogs.synthesyssolutions.com/michael/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Linus%20Torvalds.thumbnail.jpg" /><br /> Linus Torvalds
    </td>
    
    <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center">
      <img width="72" height="96" id="image110" alt="Ryan Reynolds" src="http://blogs.synthesyssolutions.com/michael/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Ryan%20Reynolds.thumbnail.jpg" /><br /> Ryan Reynolds
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you know me, then you realize these results are funny on so many levels.

(For the record the photo I used was when I had a beard and was wearing glasses. Somehow none of my results had beards, but almost all of them wore glasses.)
