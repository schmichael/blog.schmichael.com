It&#8217;s official: I&#8217;m an adjunct professor at [Greenville College in Greenville, IL][1]. I&#8217;ll be teaching CIS210: Programming and Data Structures. I chose a textbook that uses C#, but I was pretty disappointed with the state of CS2-level textbooks.

Now if I could just change that &#8220;Professor&#8221; to &#8220;Dr.&#8221; somehow&#8230;
