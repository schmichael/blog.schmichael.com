The first Linux distribution I used was [Red Hat 5][1] way back in High School. My school was using it on an already old 486 to host its new web site, and I got a shell account on it to play around in. In college I played around with Red Hat and [Linux from Scratch][2], but I fell in love with [Slackware][3].

So when I entered the busy world and started setting up some Linux servers, I chose Slackware everytime. After a few installs I began getting frustrated at the number of packages I would have to manually build from source because Slackware didn&#8217;t provide them. It was fun the first time, but I was no longer a college student with time to waste.

I started switching to [Debian][4] and have never regretted it. While Debian&#8217;s package management is a bit overzealous for my taste, I love that _it just works_.

Now I only administer one remaining Slackware server which runs a couple [LAMP][5] applications. They&#8217;re mission critical apps, yet I only check on the server periodically. It never goes down and rarely needs updates. I still compile [PHP][6] from scratch, but thats mainly because PHP configurations can vary widely depending on needs.

So while I&#8217;ll probably standardize on Debian from now on, <span style="font-weight: bold">its always a joy to login to a Slackware server and find everything working as perfectly as the day it was first installed.</span>
