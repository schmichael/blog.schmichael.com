[Coding Horror][1] has [an excellent article entitled &#8220;Where are all the Open Source Billionaires?&#8221;][2]

The businesses based on open source software compete on services. Making the software free levels the playing field and forces businesses to compete on **serving the customer better**. This is capitalism at its best.

Proprietary software on the other hand **thrives on vendor lock-in**. Microsoft wouldn&#8217;t be a (near?) monopoly today if they hadn&#8217;t squashed Netscape and Novell by aggressively [_embracing and extending_][3] those companies technologies in a way that locked them out of the market.

That being said, businesses based on open source software are still refining their business models and figuring things out. Its a new model in a very tough market to penetrate. My fear is that open source will never gain widespread acceptance beyond the &#8220;bottom of the stack&#8221; (the frameworks, compilers, operating system, server software, etc.).
