After leaving [Gnome][1]&#8216;s default music player, [Rhythmbox][2], for [Banshee][3] almost a year ago, I&#8217;m back using Rhythmbox.Â  I only have 476 songs on my computer and already managing them in Banshee was getting painful.

Rhythmbox feels like it starts faster than Banshee as well.Â  Not that I took the time to do any empirical studies, but Banshee has a splash screen which just makes it feel bulky.Â  Splash screens feel appropriate for [photo editors][4] and [bloated productivity suites][5], but music players?Â  What takes so long to load that a splash screen is necessary?

Really there&#8217;s no reason not to use Rhythmbox except Banshee is so much sexier.Â  And I guess if I was that worried about sex appeal I&#8217;d buy a Mac.
