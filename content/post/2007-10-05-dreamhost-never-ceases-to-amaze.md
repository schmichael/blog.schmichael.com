How are you supposed to feel when [your hosting company gets evicted from their office space][1]?

Ironically just a week or two ago [a friend of mine][2] had his shared hosting provider migrate his sites to a new server using _3 week old data._ So I guess things could be a lot worse than a silly little eviction.

This is why I keep all of my important sites on a [Linode][3]. <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<small>I guess my IMAP account is still sitting on DreamHost&#8217;s servers, but its been surprisingly stable lately.</small>
