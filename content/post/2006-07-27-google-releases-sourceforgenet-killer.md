Thanks to [Ben Ramsey for live blogging a presentation on Google Code][1].  Google Code is SourceForge done by Google so its simpe, fast, and efficient.  (Or so they promise.)
  
I&#8217;m moving OpenIT over to it right now as a test.  It detected that a SourceForge project of the same name already exists and allows you to e-mail the owner.  If the owner allows you to use the name, supposedly you can create the project on Google Code.

However, when I tried it I got a &#8220;502 Server Error&#8221;.  Looks like they already match SourceForge&#8217;s stability.
