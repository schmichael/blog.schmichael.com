[Dell has put up a Linux survey][1].Â  Please go take it now if you want to see Linux on Dell computers!

I see Linux (any distro, I&#8217;m really not picky) being preinstalled by OEM&#8217;s as being the major &#8220;feature&#8221; missing from Linux for home users.Â  Mozilla Firefox has enough trouble getting people to download and install a different browser; only a tiny percentage of home users are ever going to download and install a different operating system!

It seems [there&#8217;s money to be made selling Linux though!][2]
