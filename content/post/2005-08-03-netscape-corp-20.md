[A Mozilla Corporation][1] has been founded (nice [article about it on mozillaZine][2]). Please tell me I&#8217;m not the only one whose first thought was &#8220;Wait&#8230; isn&#8217;t this just Netscape Corp. 2.0?&#8221; Hopefully Mozilla Corp. [fairs better than its ancestors.][3]

**Update:** [Asa][4] clarifies that because of the subsidiary status of Moz Corp, there won&#8217;t be any IPOs or other Netscape-esque excitement.
