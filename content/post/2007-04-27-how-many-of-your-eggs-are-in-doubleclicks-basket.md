[Roberto de Almeida has a nice short post about relying on Google for most of his commonly used applications][1].

Out of my friends, I&#8217;m probably the slowest to adopt Google&#8217;s applications, and they give me grief about it all of the time. I just started using Calendar and Docs, and I&#8217;ve been using Reader for a little while. (And of course I use their search.)

I have no plans to use my Gmail account (and I use GTalk lightly) because I really don&#8217;t feel like letting 1 company know _everything_ about me. I even hesitate to put AdWords or Analytics on my blog because there aren&#8217;t many [safe havens*][2] on the web anymore.

[Now that Google has purchased DoubleClick][3], I&#8217;m even more concerned. I remember when [DoubleClick had the reputation that malware makers have today][4]. (Of course that was back when cookies were viewed with suspicion.) It used to be I feared giving all of my personal information over to Google for fear they&#8217;d be bought out by a less-than-good company. Now I fear that Google is just slowly becoming a company I don&#8217;t really want having all of my personal information!

That being said. Most of Google&#8217;s applications **rock**. Reader **rocks** (despite missing search). Calendar **rocks**. And while I don&#8217;t like Google Docs as well as [OpenOffice][5] and [AbiWord,][6] **the collaboration aspect is unbeatable**.

So we&#8217;ll see how much privacy I&#8217;ll give up in exchange for Google/DoubleClick&#8217;s services&#8230; **_Privacy_ seems to be the new currency on the Internet**.

<a title="safe_havens" name="safe_havens"></a>* By &#8220;safe havens&#8221; I mean sites that don&#8217;t send _any_ of your data to 3rd parties whether through ads or statistics like counters or Analytics.
