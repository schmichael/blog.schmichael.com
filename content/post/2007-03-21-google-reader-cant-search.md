Google is a search and ad company, so I would expect all of their products to contain at least one of those two things!

Thanks to their AJAX page loading I can&#8217;t even use my browser&#8217;s built-in page search.

I&#8217;m really enjoying Google Reader for the most part.Ã‚Â  The real killer feature I&#8217;m looking for in a feed reader is some intelligent Planet handling.

There are 2 ways of reading Planets, each with its own cons:

**Subscribe to Planet Feed**

  * Duplicate posts from people who are in multiple planets.
  * At the mercy of the Planet aggregator&#8217;s RSS mangling.Ã‚Â  (Planet posts often differ slightly from the regular RSS post.)
  * Unable to pick and choose which feeds to subscribe too in the Planet.

**Subscribe to Feeds via Planet&#8217;s OPML**

  * If OPML changes, my feed list doesn&#8217;t.
  * Hard to organize (Google Reader doesn&#8217;t seem to automatically remove duplicates.).

OPML would be the obvious choice is you could somehow _subscribe to an OPML feed_.Ã‚Â  That way I could remove prune boring blogs from Planets and allow my feed list to be automatically updated when the Planet is.

Any suggestions or am I just way too picky? ðŸ˜‰
