The title is a bit misleading, but I haven&#8217;t updated my blog in far too long.

In April I started working for [Urban Airship][1], and I&#8217;ve been meaning to upgrade my blog and move to it to a shorter URL for some time. You should be reading this on [schmichael.com][2] instead of on the old site at [michael.susens-schurter.com][3]. I think I setup the write .htaccess magic to make all of the old links properly redirect to the new domain. Sorry if I broke anything.

For anyone confused by the personal rebranding from &#8220;Michael Susens-Schurter&#8221; to &#8220;schmichael&#8221;, it&#8217;s all because I&#8217;m lazy and hate typing. Also, [there&#8217;s already a Michael at Urban Airship][4], so I&#8217;m pretty much &#8220;schmichael&#8221; to everyone these days.
