I upgraded to [WordPress 2.1.1][1] last night, and now WordPress wants me to use its spell checker instead of [Firefox][2]&#8216;s.

This is really annoying as I don&#8217;t really want or need a new spell checker. Firefox&#8217;s works great. WordPress&#8217;s is just slow and laggy because it uses AJAX.

Also, the whole auto-save feature of WordPress would be nice if Firefox didn&#8217;t already have the Session Restore feature.

Its as if WordPress&#8217;s 2.1 roadmap consisted of reimplementing Firefox 2.0 features in AJAX&#8230;

I like WordPress alot, but these new features are just a nuisance.

Anyone know how to turn these features off?

**Update:** My friend [Dan][3] pointed out that [someone has submitted a bug to WordPress for the Firefox spellcheck issue][4].
