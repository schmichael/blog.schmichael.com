I need to alter a blog a bit for a client, so I went looking for a good Django-based blog to get me started. Here are my notes starting from [google][1] and [google code searches][2]*:

  * [super blog][3] &#8211; does it exist? Not by the looks of [the link on the project page][4]. _Skipping_
  * [Banjo][5] &#8211; great name, but as far as I can tell it doesn&#8217;t exist. _Skipping_
  * [djog][6] &#8211; No documentation. No commits since 2006-12-29. _Skipping_
  * [Django Basic Blog][7] &#8211; Ran into this when [Nathan Borror first posted it][8]. Its early in development, but I think I&#8217;m going to stop here and check it out.

**Update:** Banjo does have code. I&#8217;m just not used to Launchpad, sorry! I&#8217;m also looking at [BlogMaker][9] now at [Christian&#8217;s][10] suggestion. Thanks Christian!

I&#8217;ll try to remember to post again with my results.

Someday I plan on whipping up a Django Apps repository site. Not to compete with Launchpad or Google Code, but rather to just index (and rank!) Django apps. Someday&#8230;

<small>* Thanks to <code>empty</code> on <code>#django</code> for the tip about that Google Code search.</small>
