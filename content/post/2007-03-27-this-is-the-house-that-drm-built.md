Remember all of those people* who pointed out Vista&#8217;s DRM would only added more bloat and complexity to an already bloated and overly complex operating system? [I think they were right][1].

On a side note, our Windows Update Server here at work had an update for Vista&#8217;s Norwegian translation for me to approve even though I only subscribe to English updates. How hard is it to properly classify patches?
