In case you haven&#8217;t heard, **Microsoft and Novell just entered into a partnership which is extremely beneficial to Linux**. Instead of me trying to explain it, read [Miguel de Icaza&#8217;s post][1], [Joe Audette&#8217;s post][2], and/or the [official Press Release][3].

**Update:** From what I can tell this is actually a bad thing.Â  Seems Microsoft just wants to start getting money out of Linux vendors for patent protection.Â  I don&#8217;t know&#8230; go read [groklaw][4] or something for a much better comentary. <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
