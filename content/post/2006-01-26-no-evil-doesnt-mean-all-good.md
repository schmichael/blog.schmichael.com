So Google&#8217;s censoring the Internet for China &#8212; turns out [Google&#8217;s philosophy of not being evil][1] doesn&#8217;t mean they have to be good. Turns out they&#8217;re happy to sit on the fence with the rest of the spineless capitalists (read: Yahoo! & MSN) and do whatever the biggest-potential-market-the-world-has-ever-seen tells them to do.

**Update:** Censorship in action &#8211; [Normal Google][2] vs. [Google China][3].

(Scary censhorship example stolen from [Planet PHP][4].)

**Update 2:** Evidently Google [agrees][5]:  &#8220;Filtering our search results clearly compromises our mission.&#8221;  (Thanks to [Dan][6] for the link.)
