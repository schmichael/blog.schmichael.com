If you create web pages and haven&#8217;t used the [Web Developer Toolbar extension for Firefox][1], you&#8217;re cheating yourself. You can quickly and easily troubleshoot complex styling and layout issues.

Unfortunately, since the extension is for Firefox it can&#8217;t help you when Microsoft Internet Explorer decides to magically recalculate things like widths, padding, and margins. So I went in search of a Web Developer Toolbar for Internet Explorer and came across [Microsoft&#8217;s abomination][2].

Microsoft was smart enough to call it a beta version, and so I guess that means I can&#8217;t complain that it crashed my browser, doesn&#8217;t outline elements completely, and the outline bleeds onto the bottom scroll bar.

Oh, and the interface is a hideous rip off of Firefox&#8217;s DOM Inspector and the Web Developer Toolbar.

If I wasn&#8217;t so angry at Internet Explorer, [Microsoft&#8217;s Developer Toolbar][2] would just be funny. But right now I have to figure out why a tag is 10 pixels wider on IE than Firefox. I&#8217;ve already had to fix the annoying [peek-a-boo bug][3] and [use the Javascript/CSS PNG Transperancy hack][4] to get this page I&#8217;m working on to display correctly in IE.
