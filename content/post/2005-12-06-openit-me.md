In case you&#8217;re an OpenIT user and wondering why OpenIT has been stuck at version 2.1.3, it&#8217;s all my fault. I&#8217;ve been too busy to get 2.1.3 polished up for release as 2.2. What&#8217;s worse is that Klaus, an OpenIT user, has contributed a bunch of major improvements to the Support area, that I&#8217;d love to get integrated into the 2.3 development series.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll get 2.2 released before the Holidays!
