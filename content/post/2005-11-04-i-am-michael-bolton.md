![Me][1]

_**Proof:**_ I was listening to **Jay-Z** (well, the [Grey Album][2]) while driving in my **Ford Focus** to work as an **IT consultant** while wearing my usual uniform of a **blue button down shirt** and completely generic **khakis**.

_**Further Proof:**_ I&#8217;m **white**, live in a small town in Illinois, and my name is **Michael**.

Give me some credit &#8211; at least I realize how pathetically out of touch I am.

(If you haven&#8217;t seen [Office Space][3], [none of this][4] will make any sense.)
