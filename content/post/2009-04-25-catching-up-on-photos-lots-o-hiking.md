I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to organizing and uploading over a months worth of photos off of my little digital camera. Just to make sure there&#8217;s something geeky in this post: I use [F-Spot][1] to organize and upload my photos to PicasaWeb. Despite neither of those products being terribly popular, I really enjoy them both. I&#8217;ve found PicasaWeb to be a lot easier to work with than Flickr, but Flickr definitely has a lot more support from 3rd party tools and products.

You can [view all of my photo albums][2] or just check out the ones you&#8217;re interested in:

  * [Failed Ramona Falls Hike][3] &#8211; Sam & I attempted to hike to Ramona Falls one day, but a 6&#8243; deep snow drift on [East Lola Pass Road][4] stopped us from continuing. Was still a very enjoyable day driving around Mt. Hood.
  * [Horsetail Falls Hike][5] &#8211; Fun hike in Columbia River Gorge.
  * [Saddle Mountain Hike][6] &#8211; An incredible hike that technically defeated us about a quarter of a mile before the summit. There was still a lot of snow in some spots, so we&#8217;ll have to return to finish the hike someday soon!
  * [Jen & Veen&#8217;s visit][7] &#8211; Just a random assortment of pictures from when some friends visited.
