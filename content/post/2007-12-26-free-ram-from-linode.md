I&#8217;ve said it [before][1], and I&#8217;ll say it again: I love Linode. Over Christmas they [increased the amount of RAM their customers receive][2]. I still haven&#8217;t rebooted to take advantage of the last **free** RAM increase!

Anyone looking for **reliable** [VPS][3] hosting without the significant cost and hassle of co-locating your own server: [check out Linode][4].
