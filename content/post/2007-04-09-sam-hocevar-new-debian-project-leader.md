Congratulations to [Sam Hocevar on being elected the new Debian Project Leader][1]!Ã‚Â  I was very excited when I read [Sam&#8217;s platform][2].

He&#8217;s young and seems to share a lot of my gripes about Debian.Ã‚Â  However, unlike me, he seems well equipped to _do something about them_.

Maybe I should stop churning out these debian-announce blog posts and figure out how to build a .deb.Ã‚Â  ðŸ˜‰
