Its no secret that I&#8217;ve been trying to kick my [PHP][1] habit in favor of [Python.][2]Â  However, I started using [Drupal][3] (a PHP content management system) around 4.4 or 4.5 and haven&#8217;t found any Python solutions that can even begin to compete with its ease of use and features.

With that in mind, I found it funny today when I ran across <a href="http://www.enterpriseblacklist.org/" style="font-weight: bold">a site prominently displaying a &#8220;powered by python&#8221; logo, when its obviously powered by Drupal</a>.

I&#8217;m guessing the &#8220;powered by python&#8221; actually refers to the spiders that the site uses to build its blacklist, but its still a bit misleading, if not outright disingenuous to credit Python without mentioning Drupal.

To be fair the site does look like a useful project.Â  I&#8217;m in favor of anything that reduces the monetary incentive to domain park!
