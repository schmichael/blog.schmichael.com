I used to get my nerd news fix from [Slashdot][1] like every other self-respecting geek, but I was lured away when [Digg][2] came around with its pretty interface and &#8220;wisdom-of-the-masses&#8221;.

Turns out the masses have the collective wisdom of my cat: they&#8217;re both whiny and Cat Nip is to Cats what Apple Announcements are to Digg.

So now I&#8217;m back at Slashdot, and I&#8217;ve actually [created an account][3]. I&#8217;ve found if you filter Slashdot comments to 4s and 5s, there&#8217;s actually some useful information in there.

_(As if to validate my decision, I quick dropped by Digg to see the following headlines:_ Women of Warcraft and Celebrities &#8211; Separated at Birth _and_ Japanese Teen Idol Tries To Destroy SNES Cartridges&#8230; _wow&#8230; pure quality.)_

**Update:** I should mention [Ars Technica][4] is my absolute favorite nerd news site.Â  Slashdot is for quantity, Ars is for quality, and [El Reg][5] is for hilarity.
