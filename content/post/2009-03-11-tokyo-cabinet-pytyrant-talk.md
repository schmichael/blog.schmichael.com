I did an introductory talk on [Tokyo Cabinet][1], [Tokyo Tyrant][2], [pytc][3], and [PyTyrant][4] at the [Portland Python User Group][5] meeting last night.

It was definitely just an introductory talk, so if you&#8217;re already familiar with these projects it probably won&#8217;t be very interesting.

  * [Slides (html)][6]
  * [Single page (HTML version)][7]
  * [Single page (PDF version)][8]
  * [reStructuredText (rst) source][9]

**Errata:** My slides state PyTyrant 1.1.11 doesn&#8217;t work with Tokyo Tyrant 1.1.17 &#8212; this is _wrong._ I don&#8217;t know what I was doing yesterday, but today all my tests _work on Tokyo Tyrant 1.1.17_.
