Just updated the [PEAR][1] packages in [OpenIT][2] using my handy little openitPEAR.php tool. Found a little bug in it, fixed it in 30 seconds, and updated OpenIT&#8217;s PEAR packages in another 30 seconds.

After many months of dreading bundling PEAR packages into OpenIT, I feel like I&#8217;ve achieved PEAR bliss.
