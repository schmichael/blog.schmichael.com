My friend [Dan Coulter][1] was right when he told me [Google Reader][2] is the best feed reader.Â  So long [Sage][3], I hope we can still be friends!

Wait a second though&#8230; &#8230;where are the ads?Â  If they start taking away screen real-estate for Ad-Words, I&#8217;ll probably go crawling back to Sage.
