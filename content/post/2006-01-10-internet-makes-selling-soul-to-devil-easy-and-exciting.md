I signed up for Amazon&#8217;s Associates Program because I wanted to link to books, and this way Amazon generates the spiffy HTML for me!

I guess theoretically I could make money if someone actually followed the links and bought something, but thats not really the point. The point is I&#8217;m too lazy to write my own HTML.
