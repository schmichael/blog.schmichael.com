Well I&#8217;m still not happy with my Linux/Active Directory interop setup, so I&#8217;ve started reading Microsoft&#8217;s _unfinished_ 500 page [Windows Security and Directory Services for UNIX][1]. _Lots_ of worthless project management advice to wade through to find the 50 pages of extremely useful information, but still a surprisingly good resource.
  
At any rate, my brain is too small to hold all of the information, so I&#8217;ve started making notes in a [wiki (feel free to browse)][2]. Right now, no one else can sign up or edit it because I didn&#8217;t want to fight spam or anything. Let me know if you want to help though, and I&#8217;ll create an account for you!

By the time I&#8217;m done it should be a complete guide on how to use Kerberos and LDAP to authenticate and authorize Linux/UNIX users and services via Active Directory.
