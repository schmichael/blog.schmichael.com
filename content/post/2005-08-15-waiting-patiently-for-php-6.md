[Rasmus][1] just [posted a PHP 6.0 Wishlist][2]. I love them all!

I spend a lot of my time at work using PHP, and I don&#8217;t see any of Rasmus&#8217;s proposed changes breaking any of my existing apps. I don&#8217;t use register\_globals, magic\_quotes\_*, safe\_mode, or deprecated functions.

The only problem is: will anyone switch? Large hosting providers probably won&#8217;t. I still use PHP 4 just because Linux distros have been so slow at moving to PHP 5.

At any rate, I hope Rasmus gets his way as all of his proposed changes sound excellent to me!
