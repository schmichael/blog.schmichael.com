Finally made it up to biking to work 3 times this week! Had only been averaging about once every 2 weeks for the past couple months. Sam & I recently moved to North Portland which is flat. We had been living in the very hilly Southwest area of town, and biking to work from there was killer.

I really didn&#8217;t realize how much my situation had improved until my friend, Aaron Colflesh, pointed me to [HeyWhatsThat.com][1] which generates elevation change profiles for you based on coordinates:

**My current route from home to work:**

It has a good 100&#8242; hill in it. Not fun on the way home, but it doesn&#8217;t last too long.

Now compare that to my **_old_ route from home to work:**

No wonder I never did it more than once a week! It was brutal coming home.

We&#8217;re much happier in North Portland in general, but finding these diagrams made me feel much better about struggling to get on bike at the old place. <img src="http://localhost/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
