Right after I graduated from college, I taught 2 low level CS courses over a couple of semesters. Two of my students created some sort of chat program where you could punch your friends in the face if I remember correctly. It was awesome.

Now they&#8217;ve graduated and [brought something even more amazing into this world: ManBabies.com][1]

I could try to describe it, or respond to it, but I really think you just need to see it for yourself.

I&#8217;m so proud.
