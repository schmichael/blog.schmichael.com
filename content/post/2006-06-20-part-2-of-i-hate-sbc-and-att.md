&#8230;but I love Josh the DSL Specialist.

So I called that magical SBC/at&t DSL Specialist phone number I mentioned in my last post to confirm that I should be receiving DSL service tommorow as I was told over a week ago.

Turns out when I was told I would &#8220;recieve DSL service on June 20th&#8221;, that meant my **order would be processed on the 20th**. Evidently there&#8217;s a magical wait period between ordering DSL and when that order is &#8220;processed.&#8221; Josh, the DSL Specialist I was talking to, was able to process my order while I was on the phone.

The new date for when I should be able to use DSL is Friday, June 23rd. After asking, I was finally able to get an actual order number. For the past 2 weeks I&#8217;ve been told that I didn&#8217;t have one but could call back anytime to check my order.

This is ridiculous, and if I hadn&#8217;t already wasted so much time trying to get DSL, I&#8217;d be calling the cable company.
