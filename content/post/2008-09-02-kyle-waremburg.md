When I worked at Tremont Community Schools, Kyle was still a student, but he helped build [Firewall Admin][1], a Linux desktop that spanned 9 monitors, and many robots. [He&#8217;s now blogging, and I can almost guarantee he&#8217;ll always be doing something wilder and more interesting than me!][2]
