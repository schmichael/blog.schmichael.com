According to the [current poll][1] on the [OpenIT Community Site][2], the majority of people who have voted think OpenIT should target PHP 5.0 or greater.

While I would love to use all the nifty new object oriented features of PHP 5, the simple fact remains that the servers I use (Debian and Slackware) come with PHP 4.3 or 4.4. I&#8217;m guessing that a number of the voters in the Poll are Windows users who just upgrade to whatever [PHP installer is at the top of the list.][3]

There have been lots of posts on [Planet-PHP][4] about the [slow adoption of PHP 5][5]. I think the bottom line is that it just takes time. It&#8217;s going to be years before Microsoft can convince people to migrate their numerous Visual Basic 6 applications to .Net. In the same way its going to be years before people migrate from 4 to 5 (or perhaps straight to 6).
