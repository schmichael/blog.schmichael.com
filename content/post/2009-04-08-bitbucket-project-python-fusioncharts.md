[After my last post on FusionCharts][1], someone was nice enough to e-mail me some a [Django][2] snippet for exporting [FusionCharts][3] as images, so I decided I might as well put the code in a public repository.

While I prefer Bazaar out of all the DVCSes, it seems Mercurial has captured the hearts and minds of the Python empire, so I created the [python-fusioncharts project][4] on [BitBucket][5].

If you use Python and FusionCharts, I&#8217;d love to add more snippets!
