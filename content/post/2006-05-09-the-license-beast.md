An [article over at Computer World][1] is indirectly one of the best arguments for [Free Software][2] I&#8217;ve ever read. I&#8217;ve attempted to navigate [Microsoft&#8217;s various licensing schemes][3] for small businesses before, and its always been a confusing and ardous process.

The whole idea of per-seat software licensing seems inherently flawed to me. A great deal of time and resources seems to be wasted on it by both vendors and consumers.
