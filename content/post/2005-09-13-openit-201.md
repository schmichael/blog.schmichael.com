Well [Jeremy&#8217;s][1] already committed some fixes, and users have started [sending in bugs][2], so it looks like 2.0.1 will be coming in the near future.

It&#8217;s probably a good thing that I haven&#8217;t had time to put into OpenIT since 2.0 has been released because now it will be easy to release a nice small bug fix release with no major changes. &#8230;but I do have SNMP enabled on my Windows laptop and am eager to test it out!
