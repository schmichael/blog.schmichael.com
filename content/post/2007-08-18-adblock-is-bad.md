&#8230;but [these guys are ridiculous][1].

I don&#8217;t use any sort of ad blocking extensions, plug-ins, add-ons, widgets, whatever. Ads are the currency of the Internet, and **I&#8217;m happy to put up with ads in exchange for free services**.

If a site has too many ads or their ads are obnoxious, **stop going to that site.** If you&#8217;re really cool you&#8217;ll even contact the site to let them know about your frustration. Given that most sites are looking to maximize the effectiveness of ads (not just the quantity), I would hope they would take such comments seriously.

<small>Ironically Firefox is supported by the Mozilla Foundation/Corporation, who&#8217;s more or less bankrolled by Google, who&#8217;s an ad company.Â  So if Firefox really is bad for the Internet because of AdBlocking, why would an advertising company be supporting them?<br /> </small>
