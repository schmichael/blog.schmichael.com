My wife and I have subscribed to Netflix for the past 3 years and have loved it besides one major downside: the DVDs.

It always seemed silly for us to subscribe to a service named &#8220;Netflix&#8221;, have broadband, and still have to wait for physical media to be shipped snail mail.

It seems Netflix is going to address this problem.Â  While discs in red envelopes will continue to flow, [Netflix is going to start offering online streaming video to subscribers][1]!

Now my only fear is that they&#8217;ll use either RealPlayer or some sort of terrible custom video player for streaming video.Â  With how ridiculous movie studios are, I should probably keep my expectations low&#8230;
