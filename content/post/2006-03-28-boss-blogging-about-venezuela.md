I haven&#8217;t even gotten around to blogging about Synthesys&#8217;s planned trip to Venezuela, but [my boss, Bob Rinella, has been posting like crazy!][1]

The story goes, Bob visited a school/church in Venezuela a few months ago and [has been planning a work trip Synthesys there ever since][2]. The plan is to set the school up with [Edubuntu][3] on old laptops for the children to learn basic typing and computing skills. [With the Venezuelan government&#8217;s plan to move entirely to open source][4], learning Edubuntu will hopefully give these kids a boost in the world.

This is the sort of thing I&#8217;d love to do with the rest of my life: use open source software to help those who otherwise couldn&#8217;t afford computers or expensive proprietary software.

I still need to do lots of planning, so I&#8217;ll try to post more details as I figure them out.

Please don&#8217;t hesitate to [contact me][5] if you have any questions, comments, or contributions (laptops, finanacial support, advice, etc).
