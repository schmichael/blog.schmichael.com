While I&#8217;m loving working from home, there is something to be said for human contact.  So [I signed up for a bunch of technology related interests on Meetup.com][1] and subscribed to [Peoria events at Upcoming.org][2].

I also found a local Linux User Group, [Linux User Group of Peoria][3], which I&#8217;m pretty excited about.  I&#8217;ve subscribed to their [mailing list][4], and will probably attend their upcoming meeting on July 3rd.

Anyone from the Peoria area who stumbles across this post should feel free to [contact me][5] or leave a comment if there&#8217;s some event a new-to-Peoria IT consultant shouldn&#8217;t miss.
