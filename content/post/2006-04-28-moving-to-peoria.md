I&#8217;m moving to [Peoria, Illinois][1]! My amazing wife Samantha got a job with the [First United Methodist Church][2], and we decided to move. I&#8217;m going to continue working for [Synthesys][3], but I&#8217;m looking for new clients in the Peoria area.

I&#8217;d love to work with public schools and open source software. However, since I have experience with [rural electric cooperatives][4] (from an IT perspective), I&#8217;ll probably be trying to make contacts in that sector as well.

And for you [OpenIT][5] users out there: a little funding would go a long way! Since I may not be working directly with a client who uses OpenIT anymore, I may have even <span style="font-style: italic">less </span>time to devote to it. I think OpenIT has <span style="font-weight: bold">a lot</span> of potential, so please [contact me][6] if you&#8217;re interested in seeing the pace of OpenIT development accelerate.

While I should be focusing on marketing, right now I&#8217;m going through the drama of selling my home and buying another. If you&#8217;re interested in a nice little house in Greenville, Illinois, [let me know][6]!
