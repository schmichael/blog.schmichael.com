Ironically [Mac Rumors has a video of Perceptive Pixel demonstrating their multi-touch UI running on top of Gnome][1]. (You can tell its [Gnome][2] during the scene where they&#8217;re manipulating a 3D image: Gnome&#8217;s 2 standard panels are on the top and bottom of the screen.)
  
[Ross Burton][3] points out they could very well be using [MPX][4] to achieve the multi-touch functionality.

Not only is this very cool stuff, but its exciting to see new technology prototyped and developed on top of open source software.

Although, as usual I&#8217;m sure Apple will be the first to ship a product with this technology&#8230;
