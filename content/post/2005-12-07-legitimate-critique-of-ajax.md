**Update:** Turns out it was a spoof which makes it funnier if slightly less accurate. Thanks for straightening me out Dan.

<strike>Jakob Nielsen</strike> has a great article titled [Ajax Sucks Most of the Time.][1]

I like what he&#8217;s saying. I don&#8217;t use Gmail because I like my back button. Google Maps is an amazing use of AJAX in my opinion, but when it comes to _printing_ driving directions &#8211; I go to MapQuest.

<strike>One of my favorite points that Jakob makes is that 13% of users can&#8217;t properly use AJAX powered sites. That&#8217;s approximately 3% higher than the number of people using Mozilla Firefox.</strike>
