Well we all knew [it][1] was coming, but who knew [Apple would force it on us first][2]?

I guess it almost makes sense if you mentally crunch some of their past adventures in platform lockdown:
  
[iTunes DRM][3] + [Mac Classic ROM Chip][4] ? [Trusted Platform Module][5].

&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t suck. Oh well, as long as [DVD Jon][6] is free there&#8217;s hope.

**Update:** [Looks like we&#8217;re safe&#8230;][7] for now.
