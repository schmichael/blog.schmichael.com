This morning I had a wonderful 4 hour flashback to my early computer science courses while developing a small web application. Sure the application was in PHP instead of C, C++, or Java, but the code was beautifully simple. `sscanf()` to parse some text, `assert()` to test for exceptional conditions, and lots of `print()`/`echo()`s to finish it up.

It was quite a nice break after weeks of writing a functional spec. and other fun management tasks&#8230; ugh&#8230;

I guess if anyone in Illinois is interested in a PHP app that parses [JULIE][1] ticket e-mails, [let me know][2].
