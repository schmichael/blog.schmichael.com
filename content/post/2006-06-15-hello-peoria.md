Sam and I are finally getting settled in our new house in Peoria. We&#8217;ve had plenty of fun experiences like:

  * Fixing a leak in our water main (thanks Dwayne Gibbs!)
  * Fixing our stove&#8217;s electrical outlet (thanks Josh Stuber!)
  * Rewiring all 3 phone jacks (I don&#8217;t know how they ever could have worked&#8230; tons of wires were switched and/or cut.)
  * Spending 4 hours on the phone with SBC/at&t to sign up for phone/DSL, find out they lost my DSL order, and try to sign up for free dial-up while I wait for DSL. Moral of the story: I hate SBC/att.
  * Called the police because two people were fighting in a huge SUV in front of our house late at night.
  * Visited [Tremont Turkey Festival][1] for about 30 minutes. Just as boring and expensive as I remember it.

Sam and I have also found a few great restaraunts already: [Haddad&#8217;s][2], [One World][3] (of course), [Taste of Thai][4], and a couple of Mexican and Chinese take-out places I can&#8217;t remember.
  
Now I&#8217;m trying to get back to work. I&#8217;m working from home and using dial-up until DSL gets here. I can see why Google is interested in getting people broadband connections. Using the Internet is frustrating and nearly pointless with a dialup connection.

I&#8217;m still sorting through lots of e-mail, but I&#8217;m eager to get back to work.
