I feel I owe it to my friends who put up with my senseless Python fanboying to admit [WordPress][1] is not only a great blog engine, but rocks at updates.

I just upgraded from 2.5 to 2.6 by doing a simple `svn switch http://...` and then logging into the web admin interface. It took about 30 seconds to complete.

Now compare that to my last experience upgrading [Trac][2] from 0.10 to 0.11&#8230; ugh.

<small>I love you Trac. Python just lacks an easy and efficient web app deployment method.</small>
