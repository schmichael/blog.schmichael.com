My talk, [Web Server Shootout][1], was accepted by the Open Source Bridge Conference! I&#8217;m terribly excited, but also nervous because there&#8217;s a lot I need to do between now and the conference. Expect regular updates on how my talk is progressing (always tagged with osbridge [feed]).

The [full list of sessions is up][2] (or [here][3]), and I&#8217;m very excited just to be attending the conference. Congratulations to all of the speakers!

Some of the sessions I&#8217;m particularly excited to attend are:

  * [An Introduction to Machine Learning by John Melesky][4] &#8211; A Portland Python User Group regular and really smart guy in general. Looking forward to getting my feet wet with machine learning.
  * [Drop ACID and think about data by Bob Ippolito][5] &#8211; I think the Portland Python crew that went to Pycon helped convince Bob to bring his presentation to OS Bridge, and I&#8217;m glad they did! I work with non-relational databases everyday, but I still design my apps with a relational data model in mind. This should be interesting.
  * [The Linux Kernel Development model by Greg Kroah-Hartman][6] &#8211; Its [Greg KH][7]! Come on!
  * [How Idealist.org uses technology to change the world by Michel Pelletier][8] &#8211; Another Portland Pythoneer and really smart guy. Eager to here more about open source at work in an organization. Its always fun to watch Michel present anyway.
  * [Web Testing with Windmill by Mikeal Rogers][9] &#8211; Hardly a day goes by that I don&#8217;t tell myself I&#8217;m going to improve my test coverage and skills. Windmill looks like an excellent testing tool to help me accomplish that.

There are many many more sessions I&#8217;m excited about, but I&#8217;m too sick of copying and pasting to mention anymore right now.

So [sign up to attend the Open Source Bridge Conference in Portland, OR this June!][10]
