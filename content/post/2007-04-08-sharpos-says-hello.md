[SharpOS][1] is an ambitious project to create a fully managed operating system using Mono/.Net. I tried working on the project until I realized that just knowing C# doesn&#8217;t mean you can help create an operating system written in C#.

Now it seems the project has achieved an important milestone: Hello World. Check out the [screenshot][2] and [download a virtual machine image][3].

**Update:**Â  I downloaded and ran Revision 86 of disk.img in QEMU.Â  Below are my screenshots&#8230;
