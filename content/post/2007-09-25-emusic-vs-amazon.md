[Amazon just opened their DRM-free MP3 store][1]. While I&#8217;m a happy [eMusic][2] user, [Amazon has somehow managed to convince EMI and Universal to join the DRM-free crowd][3].

I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll continue with eMusic, but I do plan on supporting Amazon&#8217;s DRM-free mp3s! I hope its successful so the other major music labels get a clue that DRM is anti-consumer.
