[I&#8217;m such a rebel.][1]

If you don&#8217;t want to read my long winded rambling posts, let me summarize:

I want to use icons from the [CC-SA licensed][2] [Tango project][3] in [OpenIT][4] which uses the [GPL][5]. Some people say they&#8217;re incompatible, and now [Jakub Steiner][6] has the Novell legal team looking into it!

I&#8217;m about to commit the new icons to OpenIT&#8217;s CVS with could possibly forever incriminate OpenIT and destroy both the free software and free culture movements at the same time.

Or maybe no one will notice and/or care&#8230; &#8230;which is the far more likely outcome.
