My wife & I just arrived in Portland, OR today after 4 grueling days of travel via Penske from Peoria, IL. 

  * Job 1 is finding a place to live, so we can move out of our friend&#8217;s apartment.
  * Job 2 is finishing up a project Chris Pitzer & I have been toying with for ages and really need to get live.

Stay tuned, and [ping me][1] if you live in Portland, OR and like Python, Linux, Web Dev, Open Source, and/or Beer. I&#8217;m always looking for exciting new contracting opportunities as well, although at the moment I&#8217;m pretty swamped with existing clients.

Right now its bed time because I&#8217;m dead tired and have a full day of apartment hunting and catching up on work ahead of me tomorrow.

<small>If you care about my personal life, feel free to look me up on Facebook. This blog is my geek outlet, but I&#8217;m not promising my personal life is any more exciting.</small>
