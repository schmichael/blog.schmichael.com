Snuck out a [new development version of OpenIT][1] even though I&#8217;ve been swamped at work lately. Work this morning included watching lots of progress bars which lends itself well to bug fixing OpenIT on a seperate machine. A SourceForge.net user, [hofrichter][2], submitted lots of very specific bugs complete with line numbers and even a few fixes. I love users like this, although no one ever sends patches &#8211; just line numbers, comments, and the occassional code snippet.

Perhaps this is a side effect of PHP being so easy to hack: it takes longer to generate & e-mail a patch then it does to open the source and fix a problem.

Oh and last night I finished reading [Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris][3] <img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=michaelsblog-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />which was wonderful and incredibly funny. It was a Christmas gift from my wife and greatly appreciated after spending the last 3 months analyzing a C# textbook for the class I was teaching.
