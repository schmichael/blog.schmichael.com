[Drop the mouse][1].
  
(Side note: Microsoft Office 2007&#8217;s behavior of showing keyboard shortcuts is absolutely brilliant. Its one of those simple features that leaves me wondering why it hasn&#8217;t always existed.)

Coding Horror doesn&#8217;t mention when a mouse is more efficient, but the use cases are pretty obvious: spacial manipulation. Web browsing, photo editing, graphic design, many video games, and, in some cases, user interface layout usually require a mouse for good reasons.
