[![Rhythmbox showing the wrong album art][1]][1]

In case the problem isn&#8217;t obvious, I&#8217;m listening to [LugRadio][2] and Rhythmbox is displaying album art for _Songs for Worship Country_. I don&#8217;t even own an album by that name, so Rhythmbox randomly picked it, one can only assume, based on its own personal preferences.

<small>Ironically despite living in the Midwest and being a Christian, I like neither Country nor Praise and Worship music.</small>
