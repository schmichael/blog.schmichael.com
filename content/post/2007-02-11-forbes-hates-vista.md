My view of Vista is that its a cheap Mac OSX rip-off with no new features of any real worth.

According to a [Forbes article][1], I&#8217;m being _way_ too nice.

While the author seems a bit more angry than I would expect, Microsoft does seem to consider rearranging common locations, renaming programs, and altering icons between versions a &#8220;feature.&#8221;

My favorite part of the article is when the author discovers Vista&#8217;s WordPad can no long open Word documents. Obviously this is a security feature meant to protect users from the [multiple unpatched vulnerabilities that have plagued Microsoft Word for months][2].

Unofficial patches have sprung up [here][3], [here][4], [here][5], and [here][6]. ðŸ˜‰
