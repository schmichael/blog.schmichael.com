I just posted my second talk proposal for the Open Source Bridge Conference:

[
  
Introduction to Django: The Who, What, and When][1]

[As with my other talk, Web Server Shootout,][2] I&#8217;m not trying to convince anyone of anything. We&#8217;re all already inundated with plenty of senseless marketing and fanboyism.

I&#8217;d rather present my knowledge, experiences, mistakes, and opinions in an effort to help others make more intelligent decisions about the development platforms they choose to use.*

Let me know what you think!

<small>*If that was dripping with too much sappy altruism, do remember I get into the conference free if either proposal gets selected. ðŸ˜‰</small>
