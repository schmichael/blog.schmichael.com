I&#8217;m trying to find out if CALs from a Windows 2000 Server can be &#8220;upgraded&#8221; and used on a Windows 2003 Server. HP said yes and then no. Dell said no. I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;m just going to have to repurchase all of those licenses if I upgrade.

The reason for this is that I help manage an aging Windows 2000 Server with 100 CALs, but its not even setup as a domain server. The server is a flaky old Dell with numerous parts replaced, so I&#8217;d like to just buy a new Dell or HP with Windows 2003 Server installed and not have to repurchase 100 CALs.

I&#8217;d love to just use [Samba][1] on Linux, but there&#8217;s a third-party ISV involved that will probably require us to have a vanilla Microsoft Windows network.

**Update:** Heard from someone else who said the answer was no, **Win2k CALs _cannot_ be upgraded.Â **
