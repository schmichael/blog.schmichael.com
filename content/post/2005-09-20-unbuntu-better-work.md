I&#8217;m installing [Ubuntu 5.10][1] on a friend&#8217;s home computer tonight, and I&#8217;m a bit nervous.

I&#8217;ve forced my wife to use [Debian Etch][2] on our home computer, and she&#8217;s gotten used to it. (A pretty theme helped a lot!) It was a bit rough at first (especially getting used to [OpenOffice.org][3]), but now she rarely has any problems using it. In fact I&#8217;m sure her only big compliant would be when I broke the sound for 3 weeks by installing a bunch of packages from [Debian Sid][4] in the middle of the [glibc, Gnome 2.10, and X.org transitions][5]&#8230; I&#8217;ve since learned my lesson about messing around in unstable (sid) unless you know what you&#8217;re doing (and have lots of time to do it!).

At any rate, this friend has quite the workstation: SATA RAID, dual monitors, firewire, a bunch of USB devices, etc. so I&#8217;m nervous about everything working out-of-the-box.

Also he&#8217;s keeping a Windows XP partition because he does a lot of video editing, and I&#8217;m not going to guarantee that he likes anything in Linux better than the professional video editing suites he uses in Windows.

We&#8217;ll see what happens&#8230;

**Update:** It worked. Beautifully.
