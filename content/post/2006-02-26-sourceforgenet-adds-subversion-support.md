[SourceForge.net][1] finally adds yet another feature that its free and open source fork, [GForge][2], has had for some time: [Subersion support!][3]

I&#8217;ll be migrating [OpenIT][4] as soon as 2.2 is released.

OpenIT is actually the last project I work on that uses CVS, so it looks like I&#8217;ll be able to remove [TortoiseCVS][5]. Thank you TortoiseCVS for making CVS bareable to use, and for laying the groundwork for [TortoiseSVN][6].
