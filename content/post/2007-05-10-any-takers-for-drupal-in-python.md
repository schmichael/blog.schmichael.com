I half-jokingly [posted a comment on Dries Buytaert blog about re-implementing Drupal in Python][1].Â  Honestly, I expected to either be flamed or ignored, but instead it turns out I&#8217;m not the first person to think of this!Â  Some people even suggested Haskell&#8230;Â  I think something a tad more mainstream like Python would fair much better.

Another commenter suggested **Python doesn&#8217;t need Yet Another Web Framework** which is absolutely true!Â  However, **Python desperately needs an easy to use Content Management System**, and Drupal is the best there is!

I posted a follow-up comment asking for anyone interested in pursuing such a wild course of action to contact me.

If you&#8217;ve read much of my blog, you know I&#8217;m relatively new to [Python,][2] but [CherryPy][3] and [Genshi][4] seem ideal for implementing [Drupal.][5]Â  CherryPy gives you the nice URLs and module layout while Genshi allows for a very similar theming experience.
