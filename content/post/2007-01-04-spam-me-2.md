Setup a new e-mail server at work, and I just can&#8217;t wait to get some real world spam to test out SpamAssassin. However, I don&#8217;t really want to give spammers any sort of permission to e-mail me&#8230;

So for the record, do _**not**_ send e-mails about viagra, stock tips, or cheap meds to <michael@tremont702.us> or <mschurter@tremont702.us>.

Non-spammers are welcome to send me some test e-mails to help me figure out how strict of filtering I can get away with.

**Update:** Success! Received my first spam and SpamAssassin properly caught. Either that or I really did win the &#8220;_draw of South African 2010 World cup Bid lottery Award International_&#8221; and thanks to SpamAssassin I will never get my $1,000,000&#8230;
