I wish I could brag that I&#8217;ve never linked to fluff &#8220;Top 5/10/20/100&#8221; pieces, but something struck me about PC World&#8217;s [The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products][1] (found via [Slashdot][2]):

**The [Top 10][3], which were the products chosen by users, is more or less a list of the top 10 most popular software applications.**

I agree with most of them as well:

  1. **AOL CDs** &#8212; Definitely most annoying. Yet AOL dominated the ISP industry until broadband decimated its dial-up business.
  2. **Windows Me** &#8212; Ironically I was the only person I knew with a Windows Me laptop that _didn&#8217;t hate it_. It was a terrible product, yet very popular due to the fact there were a couple of years where every consumer grade computer came with it.
  3. **Anything with DRM** &#8212; _**Amen!**_ Yet DRM-laden music services are the most popular. Wise up people: join [eEmusic][4]!
  4. **McAfee & Norton Internet Security Suites*** &#8212; These pieces of bloatware are the only products that make Outlook seem trim and sexy. Forget bulky security suites and just get Linux or even a Mac.
  5. **RealPlayer** &#8212; Worst. Media player. Ever. Yet tons of sites choose it for content delivery. To make matters worse its the only major media player to [offer an open source version (which is just as terrible as the proprietary version)][5].
  6. **Bonzi Buddy** &#8212; The malware that started it all.
  7. **MySpace** &#8212; A terrible blackhole crushing the souls of our youth into a singularity of narcism. Yet its the only way I can stay in touch with some of my friends&#8230; I feel dirty&#8230;
  8. **Windows Update** &#8212; Since I&#8217;m basically in charge of Windows Updates at work, my hatred for Windows Update runs deep. Whatever software architect thought _updating an operating system via an ActiveX control in a web browser was a good idea needs to find a new line of work._ Who would come up with such a terrible system? The only way it could be worse is if it used _Outlook Express as its delivery mechanism._
  9. **Windows Vista** &#8212; Hey, other people voted for it, not me. ðŸ˜‰
 10. **Apple QuickTime** &#8212; Just as worthless and bloated as all of the other major media players.

With the exception of Bonzi Buddy, **the other products all represent industry leaders** (or were at some time). There&#8217;s plenty of alternatives out there (and not just open source ones), but for the most part users are lazy: they&#8217;ll use whatever comes with their computer. And even I&#8217;ll admit switching and learning something new is difficult.

<small>* Personal anecdote about Symantec (a.k.a. Norton) products: You can&#8217;t use secure e-mail (SMTP/POP3/IMAP via SSL/TLS) with them because then they can&#8217;t do their flaky transparent proxy virus scanning. How&#8217;s that for security?</small>
