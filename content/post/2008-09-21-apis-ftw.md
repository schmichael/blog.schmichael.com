[Thanks to El Reg for reminding us that new APIs really aren&#8217;t any reason to get excited.][1]

My $0.02 (because everyone is _dying_ to know):

  * [Google Gears][2]* &#8211; A SQL database client-side? Aren&#8217;t we trying to get away from SQL as the de facto data persistence backend? Isn&#8217;t Google the one leading the charge (see [MapReduce][3])? I&#8217;m so confused&#8230;
  
      
    Ironically this tech stands a chance to survive because (1) its Google, the Microsoft of the web, and (2) nothing else can offer offline capabilities like it can.
  * OpenID &#8211; The API that tried to make Internet accounts less annoying and did the opposite. Good job guys.
  
    The only time I&#8217;ve successfully used it was at stackoverflow.com, and thats because they _forced me._ It took me many failed attempts, setting up a technorati account just to fail with it, and finally succeeding because I had been entering Yahoo&#8217;s OpenID URL slightly wrong (its just http://yahoo.com?!). Yeah, I expect to see my non-techie friends use this just as soon as they start using vim and latex.
  * OpenSocial &#8211; I don&#8217;t even care enough to read up on this to make fun of it.

<small>* I hear WordPress&#8217;s new admin interface can use Google Gears&#8230; why? It seems to work fine without Gears installed. I guess offline blog editing might be handy, but vim can do that just fine&#8230;</small>
