I didn&#8217;t realize [PEAR was going to become a means of distribution for PHP web applications.][1] I always thought of PEAR as being an easy way to get PHP extensions, but not whole applications. It probably would have helped if I had realized PEAR stands for PHP Extension and **Application** Repository.

I probably won&#8217;t attempt this with OpenIT until after PEAR 1.4 is released, but I have high hopes that this will make installation much easier.
