Yesterday I got to work on a setup program written in [NSIS][1] which I hadn&#8217;t touched in months. A quick glance at the code brought sweat to this PHP-junkie&#8217;s brow. However, in about 30 seconds the code came into focus and it was the easiest thing in the world to follow and maintain.

Perhaps the best thing about NSIS is that if you ever think &#8220;It&#8217;d sure be nice if it could &#8230;&#8221;, just hop over to the [NSIS Wiki][2] &#8211; chances are someone has already posted a solution to your problem.

In fact, for any of you OpenIT on Windows users out there, NSIS has some nice plug-ins for dealing with IIS. (Just don&#8217;t look at me to hack that together! I don&#8217;t even have a Windows box I&#8217;m willing to put IIS on!)
