So yesterday I raved about using Evolution for e-mail. Things are a bit less rosy today. No showstoppers, just annoyances:

  * Startup takes about 2 minutes now including about **90 seconds of nothing being displayed.**
  * **Moving an IMAP folder pretty much borked that account**. Didn&#8217;t lose any e-mails, just lots of strange errors messages about not being subscribed to folders or folders no longer existing (even though they do). I was able to fix everything using Squirrel Mail.
  * Exchange **Contacts stopped working**.
  * **New Mail Notification** via a plug-in is **far more complex** than it needs to be, or maybe I&#8217;m just stupid.

In Evolutions defense:

  * I am using the old **2.6 version** of Evolution, so perhaps some of these issues have been resolved in **2.8**.
  * IMAP was very **flaky in Thunderbird** as well.
  * The **Mailing List Plugin** features are fantastic as are the filtering capabilities.

**Update:** Added 2 new woes.
