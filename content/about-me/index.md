My name is _Michael Susens-Schurter_ (but I&#8217;m often lazy and shorten it to just _Michael Schurter_) and go by **schmichael** online. I&#8217;m married to the beautiful [Samantha Wistera][1] and currently a developer at [Urban Airship][2].

You can stalk me various places around the web:

  * [e-mail][3]
  * [Twitter as @schmichael][4]
  * [Photos on Picassa][5]
  * [LinkedIn][6]
  * [Facebook][7]
  * schmichael on FreeNode or OFTC

<small>For the curious: &#8220;good good study day day up&#8221; is a literal translation of a Chinese proverb more accurately translated as: &#8220;Only if you study hard will you make progress everyday.&#8221;</small>
